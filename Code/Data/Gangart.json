Line a large nonstick spring-form pan with parchment paper and fill with the batter. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 \u00b0F (175 \u00b0C or gas mark 2) for 30 minutes - it will only rise up partway.

Remove pan from heat and let cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Finely grate the bittersweet chocolate using a microplane grater and divide into two portions. Beat 1\u00bd cups of the cream until stiff peaks form. Stir chopped nuts and half (one portion) of the grated chocolate gently into the cooled melted chocolate mixture. Gently fold together the whipped cream and the cooled melted chocolate mixture until just combined. Remove ring from spring-form pan and carefully slice the cake into three even (very thin) layers using a large serrated knife.

Spread the remaining chocolate ganache mixture all over the top and sides of the cake. Chill for 2 hours. Knead the marzipan(with enough powdered sugar to make it sweet if unsweetened) until well blended. Place marzipan between two sheets of wax paper and roll out into very flat circle, about the size of your spring-form pan. Set a plate on top of the marzipan and use the plate as a guide to cut out a perfect circle; then cut circle into 16 triangles. Set the marzipan triangles in a spiral around the top of the chilled cake, pressing down slightly so they stick - there should be very narrow gaps between each triangle - if desired, curl up the pointy tips decoratively first. Coat the sides of the cake with some the remaining grated chocolate. Beat the remaining \u00be cups of cream with the vanilla granulated sugar or sugar to taste until stiff peaks form. Shortly before serving, garnish cake with swirls of the whipped vanilla cream, the remaining chopped nuts, and sprinkle any remaining grated chocolate on top.",

Pinch off the end of the dough before you close the circle to make the ring just a fraction smaller than the previous one.

Use a compass to draw the circumference of the bottom ring - the largest one - and as many more of the progressively smaller rings as you can fit on the cookie sheet. Continue in this fashion until you have marked out as many rings as you plan to have. butter and dust the cookie sheets with flour. Lay the rings on the sheets after they have been shaped on the wax-paper patterns.

They are also available in jars from some fruit markets (especially ones that carry a lot of Greek/Italian imported foods). Depending on the size, you will need 20 to 40 grape leaves (fila - pronounced fee'-lah). Small leaves tend to be more tender. Boil grapes or grape leaves until they are soft, but not tender. The time will depend on the leaves. Fresh ones will only take a minute. Fold grape leaves around small spoonfuls of meat mixture, sealing completely.

But if you prefer butter or margarine, that's fine too. The first slice you should cook for a few minutes on each side. Then with the other slices, after the pan has had a chance to really get hot, it only takes a couple of minutes each side to get it brown. Depending on how much of the milk and egg mixture you let sink into each slice, it can make from 4-8 sourdough slices. I like to use strawberry syrup, but you can use any syrup you like. You can even make your own syrup by mixing two cups of granulated sugar or sugar, one cup or water, a teaspoon of vanilla extract and whatever flavoring (strawberry, blueberry, cherry) you want. Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for about five minutes. For thicker syrup, you can add clear karo syrup, too. And to finish it all off, you can add a couple of (big) spoonfuls of nondairy topping or cool whip (or any whipped cream) on top. Yummy. Enjoy!.",

You should have about 10 \"eggs\".  Hand-shape the piece of dough into a disc that can fit into your pan. or, use the rolling pin on a floured surface and roll dough out into a disc. You can prepare all the discs first or make them as you go. Now, fry the dough and watch closely. The frying oil should be medium-hot, but not smoking. Fry the bread on each side a few minutes or until it is a nice light brown. Use two forks to flip the bread over and be careful not to flip hot oil on yourself!  Drain the fry-bread on paper towels and serve immediately!",

Dissolve the granulated sugar or sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over low heat until the butter melts, the gritty sounds cease, and the spoon glides smoothly over the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil. Boil, after washing down any crystals that may have formed, with a pastry brush dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath, using as little water as possible. Introduce the pre-warmed thermometer. Reduce the heat while keeping the fudge at a boil. Stir no more than necessary. Test the fudge mixture in the ice-cold water when the mixture thickens and bubbles become noisy. Ball, formed in ice water, should hold its shape until the heat from your had begins to flatten it and should be al dente -- slightly chewy -- between 230\u00b0F and 240\u00b0F. Because of the molasses and brown sugar, it can ball at a lower temperature than some other fudges. Shock by placing the saucepan in the cold water in the sink. Seed by adding, without stirring, the vanilla. Then allow to cool. Stir when luke warm and \"skin\" forms on the top (110\u00b0F). Return the thermometer to its hot water bath to soak clean. Stir the fudge thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with an electric mixer, or with a food processor. Pause frequently to allow the fudge to react. Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, and become lighter in color or streaked with lighter shade, give off some heat, suddenly stiffen. If mixing by had, the fudge will \"snap\" with each stroke; by mixer, mixer waves will become very distinct, by food processor, fudge will flow sluggishly back to the center when the processor is stopped. Add the optionals (\u00bd cup chopped nuts (walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts (filberts)) before the fudge totally candies.

Fry peppers and onions over moderate heat in the pan in which the meat was browned, stirring frequently. Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and spread over meat. Pour out any remaining fat. Add beef broth to frying pan and cook and stir over moderate heat to absorb and brown particles remaining in the pan. Add remaining ingredients to broth. Mix well and pour over meat. Stir the meat and vegetables lightly with a fork to distribute the broth and vegetables. Cover tightly and bake at 325\u00b0F for about 1 \u2013 1\u00bd hours or until the meat is tender. Serve 1 piece of steak with some of the sauce per serving.",

Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (or 210\u00b0C). Beat the eggs and Granulated sugar or Sugar in a small steel mixing bowl over the simmering water (double boiler), until the temperature reaches about 110 \u2013 120\u00b0F (or 40 \u2013 45\u00b0C). Remove from heat. Continue beating until light and creamy - until it cools down again. Add the flour and starch, then fold gently. Be careful not to overmix. On a greased baking pan, line up a sheet of silicon or wax paper. Spread the sponge base mixture thin over the sheet of silicon or wax paper. The shape is not important as this will just be the cake base that will be hidden by the meringue. A rough rectangle will be okay. Bake quickly in the oven for about 4 \u2013 5 minutes, then remove from oven and let it cool. The cake should come off the paper quite easily. In your choice of mold (we used an oblong-shaped mold - see picture), cover the bottom and sides with pieces of the cake. Put in the softened ice cream to fill the mold. Cover the top with cake, then freeze for about 3 hours. Prepare the meringue by beating the egg whites with the confectioners Granulated sugar or Sugar until stiff. Place in a piping bag. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (210\u00b0C). Unmold the frozen cake-ice cream on a baking tray. Pipe the meringue mixture all around to completely cover the cake-ice cream. You can make shapes with the meringue. When completely covered with the meringue, put it in the oven to bake for 2 \u2013 4 minutes. The meringue surface will bake very quickly, and the edges will start to brown. When the edges have browned enough, remove from the oven. The meringue surface will be baked, while the ice cream inside remains frozen. Decorate with cherry or cherries or candies, then serve.",

Beat the eggs well with the molasses and flavoring. Put the butter into a large warmed bowl and beat until soft; then add the Granulated sugar or Sugar and beat until light and creamy.

Reduce the oven heat slightly every hour\u2014about 10 degrees. Test with skewer for doneness. Keep the paper wrapped around the cake in place until completely cooled, so that the cooling takes place slowly. After completely cooled, invert the cake, lift the baking parchment off the bottom, and sprinkle the cake generously with the spirit of your choice. Wrap well in foil, put in a sealed tin, and keep in a cool place (not necessarily refrigerated). The cake benefits from occasional unwrappings and sprinkling with more spirit.

Line a strainer or colander with a coffee filter or strong paper towels. Turn the open container upside down in the strainer. Place over a bowl and refrigerate. A couple times a day, discard the liquid that drains out (the dogs will love it!). This makes a thick yogurt cheese. Preheat oven to 325F. Line a heavy deep-dish pie plate with a single layer of graham crackers, breaking some to fit. Set aside. Combine the Granulated sugar or Sugar, salt and cornstarch. Blend in the cream cheese (your mixer works great, but don't use the food processor; it will break up the mixture and it may not set). Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well. Finely grate the peel from the lemon and add to the mixture, then juice the lemon and add the juice as well. Add the vanilla. On slow speed, blend in the strained, thickened yogurt. Mix gently but well. Spoon into the prepared deep-dish pie plate, being careful not to dislodge the graham crackers. Bake for approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, or just until cheesecake mixture is set and doesn't jiggle when you move the pie plate. (Results may vary greatly depending on exact oven temperature, ingredient temperature, thickness of pie and type of pie plate). While the pie is cooling, prepare the topping. Wash, hull and slice strawberries thickly. Add 1 Tablespoon of Granulated sugar or Sugar, and stir to coat. Let them sit to draw out some of the juice. Combine the rest of the Granulated sugar or Sugar and the cornstarch. Add the water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil and thickens. Add the strawberries and stir gently just until it comes to a full boil again. They shouldn't be cooked, just heated through. Add coloring and flavor if desired and mix gently. Set aside to cool slightly. When the topping starts to set up, spread it over the top of the Cheesecake filling. Refrigerate. Served chilled with lite or fat-free whipped topping if desired.'''More at http://sneakykitchen.com/Recipes/cheesecake_pie.htm'''",

    "directions_string": " This recipe makes a very large amount (about 28 cups) of fruit cake batter and can be baked in a number of different sizes of pan. If you want to make several small cakes for gifts you can divide the batter among 9 8x4x3 inch loaf pans using a generous 3 cups of batter for each. Or if you wish to use larger loaf pans you can put the batter in 6 9x5x3 inch pans using a generous 4 \u00bd cups batter in each. Bundt pans make attractive cakes and this amount of batter is enough for 3 12 cup bundt pans using a generous 9 cups of batter in each. If you use 10-inch tube pans you can make 2 cakes using 12 cups of batter for each and an 8x4x2 \u00bd inch loaf pan with the remaining batter. Of course you can also use any combination of these sizes. For example, you can make a large cake in a bundt pan, two 9x5x3-in loaves and three 8x4x3-inch loaves. If you wish you can prepare half the batter and bake it in three 9x5x3-inch loaf pans or in one 12-cup bundt pan and one 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Line greased pans with greased heavy brown paper, except for the bundt pan which should be greased and floured. Combine nuts and fruit in a very large bowl or roasting pan. Add 1 cup of flour and toss by hand to coat fruit with flour. Cream butter well (you can use your electric mixer for this part of the recipe). Add Granulated sugar or Sugar and beat until fluffy. Beat in egg yolks. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Sift 5\u00bd cups flour with salt, spices and soda and add to creamed mixture alternately with prune juice and brandy. Mix with a wooden spoon. Add this mixture to the fruit and nuts and blend well.the easiest way to blend this large amount of mixture is with your hands. Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into mixture. Measure into prapared pans and press well into the corners. Heat oven to 275 \u00b0F. Bake cakes in 8x4x3-inch pans for about 3 hours, in 9x5x3-inch pans or bundt pans for about 3 hours and 15 minutes and in 10-inch tube pans about 3 \u00bd hours or until a toothpick stuck in the center comes out clean. Let stand in pans a few minutes, then turn out on racks and cool. Strip off paper and wrap cakes in cheesecloth dampened with brandy and then in foil and store in a cool place.",

Knead for about 10 minutes, then cut slashes with a knife in several places (this allows more air to get in dough)  Add about 2 cups more of flour, kneading as you work. Cut through twice more while kneading about 5 minutes longer. Total kneading time is about 10 to 15 minutes. Use 4 tablespoons reserved butter when called for hereafter. Lightly grease a warm roasting pan with butter. Lightly grease a clean table top and turn dough once so that all is lightly covered with butter. Place greased dough in pan; butter top with fingertips, so that no crust will form. Cover with cloth and let rise 1 to 1\u00bd hours in warmed oven. Butter 4 loaf pans.

For best results, roll out your dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper, then peel away the paper and cut the crust in a 9 inch circle. Place the circle inside a 9 inch spring-form pan. Prick the crust several times with a fork to keep the crust from puffing up during the baking. Place the spring-form pan in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. Allow to cool. Using the leftover dough, line the sides of the spring-form pan. Press the dough against the sides of the pan, smoothing it so as to have a continuous layer of crust all the way around the sides of the pan. Make sure that the side crust meets the bottom crust all the way around. Brush the reserved egg white onto the shell, covering the bottom and sides.

Next, I mixed the sauerkraut, brown sugar, salt and pepper together in a bowl: this is where you could add caraway seeds, I don't like them and didn't have any on hand, so I didn't put them in the recipe. I poured the sauerkraut mixture over the pork rib mixture in the pot. Next I added the sauerkraut juice, apple juice and water. The recipe in my book asked for 1\u00bd cups water, so I knew I needed that much total liquid. Next I added the potato and carrot. I gently pushed the potato and carrot pieces down into the sauerkraut and added a sprinkle of dried thyme which could be omitted if you don't like thyme. I put on the lid, put on the temperature gauge and turned up the heat to medium high. After the gauge began to rock, I turned the heat down to low and set a timer for 15 minutes. I stayed in the kitchen to be sure the gauge was gently rocking on a very low flame on my gas stove. After 15 minutes, I cut off the flame on the stove and let the pot rest for 3 minutes. Then I carefully carried the pot to the sink and turned on the tap for a slow drizzle of cold water over the pot. When the handle lock latch and the over-pressure vent went down, it was safe to open the pot and enjoy the aromas. The meat is fork tender and delicious, the potato and carrot completely cooked soft, but not mushy and still hold shape. The sauerkraut is tender and mild with just a hint of tang.",

Once all 6 eggs are added, spoon the mix into a piping bag with a rosette nozzle and chill for 30 minutes. Heat 4cm oil in a medium heavy-based pan until a cube of stale bread browns in 20 seconds. Pipe straight or curly shapes of paste into the oil with one hand and chop off the paste using scissors with the other. Cook for 1 minute, then turn with tongs, cook for 1 minute more and drain. (NB: When the churros start to brown too quickly, turn the heat off and let the oil cool down a little so that the churros turn a lovely golden colour.) Serve dusted with sugar. To make the hot chocolate, combine the chopped chocolate and milk in a large heavy-based saucepan and stir over moderate heat until the chocolate has melted.

    "directions_string": " Make the cure by combining the salt, sugar and pepper in a small bowl. Have the Lapsang souchong tea close at hand. Examine the salmon for bones by visual inspection and by running your finger down the length of the fillet. If you find any bones, remove them with needle nose pliers or tweezers. Draping the salmon over an inverted bowl will help force the tips of the bones up, making them easy to grasp and remove. Rinse salmon fillets thoroughly under cool running water and pat dry. Set aside. Lay out a 2 foot length of plastic wrap and place the 2 pieces of salmon side by side, skin side down. Sprinkle the fillets with a little of the Saffron vodka to moisten the fillets. Spoon the salt, sugar, and white pepper mixture onto the exposed salmon flesh, making sure to cover as much of the exposed areas. Next, spread a dusting of Lapsang souchong tea evenly over the salmon fillets. Two Tablespoons should be enough, but I\u2019ve seen recipes that use up to a cup of this tea. Press down gently to adhere the cure to the salmon. Bring the 2 pieces of salmon together like a sandwich, skin side on the outside, sugar/tea on the inside. Wrap tightly with the plastic wrap. Place packet on another piece of plastic and wrap again. Place the packet in a glass baking dish. Some recipes think you should weigh it down with either heavy soup cans or a foil-wrapped brick, to press the ingredients together. Either you have room for this in your refigerator or not. Refrigerate for at least 2 days until slightly translucent, which may easily be an extra day, flipping the salmon package over every 12 to 24 hours and re-weighting. The salmon will shed a lot of liquid which you will use to baste. Optional, but helpful is to open the package every 12 \u2013 24 hours and baste, inside and out, with the accumulated juices and see how the cure is going. Once the curing period's over (on the third day when the flesh has lost its translucence), unwrap the fish over the sink. Now you can either gently rinse off the surface salt cure and Lapsang souchong tea or simply scrape off the salt and tea mixture leaving just a little of the mixture behind. I don\u2019t mind the loose tea, but too much salt is just that, too much. Pat dry. Re-wrap with clean plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. The gravlax will keep for several days, tightly wrapped in the refrigerator. '''To Serve:'''Place fillets skin side down on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut the gravlax. (Filet knives, boning knives, and Japanese sashimi knives work well for this role.) Position the gravlax so you will be cutting from the tail end (the small end) first. The gravlax should be sliced thinly on the bias (at an angle). Each slice should be detached from the skin.",

The batter is thick; if you like, it can be thinned with a small amount of water or a little more buttermilk. Cook pancakes on a lightly greased griddle. Pancakes should be turned only once. They are ready to be turned when bubbles form in the middle and the edges appear cooked. Once pancakes are turned, use a pastry brush to spread the additional melted butter on top of the pancakes while the other side is cooking. This will keep you from having to spread cold butter on them, which will tear them. The pancakes will already be buttered once they reach the table. Top with real maple syrup. ",

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and set the pan on a baking sheet. Bake as directed. Cover with aluminum foil partway through baking if the top browns too quickly. The finished cheesecake will have a dull finish. The center should be soft, but it should not wobble. Run a knife around the sides of the cooled cake to loosen it from the pan.

Bake a 325\u00b0F for 1 to 1\u00bd hours depending on the size of the shell. This is the tricky part. An over baked shell will not support the weight of the soup so under-baking is preferred. Bake the pumpkin shell until it begins to soften. Remove from the oven and cool. Gently scoop out some of the soft pumpkin from the wall, being careful not to puncture the shell.

The Japanese persimmons usually don\u2019t have seeds. Once the seeds and dried sepals are removed, add both the pulp and the skin to a blender and make a puree. One can of coconut milk (13.5 ounces) diluted with water until you have 2 \u00bd cups liquid works very well as a substitute for the rich milk. Coco King brand coconut milk with 23-25% daily value of fat is my favorite. Mix the milk, melted margarine, eggs and persimmon puree in a blender. Pour into a large mixing bowl. This mixture may start to set up like a pudding because of the high soluble fiber content of the persimmons; however, you will be able to break it up easily by stirring and return it to a liquid state. Sift the dry ingredients together except for the raisins and walnuts. Add everything to the large mixing bowl. Mix well. Bake the pudding in an uncovered, greased 9 x 3 inch heavy glass casserole dish until softly firm (there should be movement when tilted) about 80 minutes. Bake 75 minutes if serving the following day. Let sit for 5 minutes and then run a sharp knife around the edge between the glass and the pudding to aid in releasing later. Let sit uncovered another 50 minutes as the pudding will continue to cook and set up after you have removed it from the oven. The leftover pudding will slice very cleanly the following day after being refrigerated. You may want to consider slightly less baking time as some liquid in the center can make a wonderful sauce to spoon over the pudding. Leftovers that have the liquid in the middle, microwave quite well. Topping the pudding with hard sauce, whipped cream or topping is recommended.",

Use when grilling chicken (or meat); brush lightly over the chicken during the last few minutes of grilling. This sauce is also great for dipping; set some sauce aside for passing at the table.",

    "directions_string": " Preheat oven to 300\u00b0 F. Grease and flour cookie sheets; set aside. Grease and flour several 3-inch round molds. To make the meringue, combine flour and cashews in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Process until the nuts are finely chopped; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on high speed until stiff only but not dry. Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix up the flour-nut mixture gradually. Arrange the round molds on the prepared cookie sheet. Pipe mixture into the molds or spread evenly using an offset spatula. Bake for 15 minutes or until lightly golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes before removing from the molds. Set aside. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make a total of about 40 meringue discs. Place 20 meringue discs and any broken discs in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Process to make crumbs. Transfer to a shallow bowl and set aside. To make the buttercream: Combine sugar and water in a saucepan. Boil until it reaches 238\u00b0 F. Meanwhile, combine the egg yolks and the whole egg in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Whip on high speed for about 10 minutes or until the mixture forms a ribbon pattern when the paddle is lifted. The mixture should be pale yellow. Just add salt. When the sugar syrup has reached its desired temperature, carefully pour the boiling syrup into the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream. Whip continuously on high speed until the mixture has cooled and the bowl is cool to the touch. Lower the mixer's speed to medium. Gradually add butter, 1 cube at a time. The mixture might look broken and curdled. Whip a little longer and the mixture will come together. Once smooth, add vanilla extract. To assemble, spread about 1 to 2 tablespoons buttercream on one side of a meringue disc. Cover with another meringue disc to make a sandwich. Spread buttercream all over the sandwich to cover all surfaces, including the sides. Roll the ''silvanas'' in meringue crumbs, then refrigerate or freeze until the buttercream is firm. Serve cold and plain or with other desserts. Sell per piece, if desired.",
