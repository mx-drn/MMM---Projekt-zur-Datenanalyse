On a very well-floured surface, roll dough as thick as you would for pie crust (can divide it into 2 parts if desired). Cut 5\" circles (using any container with 5\" opening) and place filling on center of each circle. Brush beaten egg on lower edge of circles. Fold over and press edges with fork dipped in flour.

But if you prefer butter or margarine, that's fine too. The first slice you should cook for a few minutes on each side. Then with the other slices, after the pan has had a chance to really get hot, it only takes a couple of minutes each side to get it brown. Depending on how much of the milk and egg mixture you let sink into each slice, it can make from 4-8 sourdough slices. I like to use strawberry syrup, but you can use any syrup you like. You can even make your own syrup by mixing two cups of granulated sugar or sugar, one cup or water, a teaspoon of vanilla extract and whatever flavoring (strawberry, blueberry, cherry) you want. Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for about five minutes. For thicker syrup, you can add clear karo syrup, too. And to finish it all off, you can add a couple of (big) spoonfuls of nondairy topping or cool whip (or any whipped cream) on top. Yummy. Enjoy!.",
