Sift the flour with the salt into a large bowl. Make a depression in the centre of the flour and pour in the yeast liquid, the remaining lukewarm water, and the olive oil. Beat with a wooden spoon until it all clings together, adding a drop more water if required, then turn out on to a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes. Put the dough back in a clean bowl, lightly oiled, and cover it with cling film (saran wrap). Stand the bowl in a warm place for 1 \u2013 2 hours until the dough has roughly doubled in volume. Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce). When the dough has risen sufficiently, knock it back (punch it down), and turn out on to a floured board. Knead again briefly for about 2 to 3 minutes, and divide it into 2 pieces. Roll each piece out fairly thinly. Pick up each one and pull it gently between the hands to make a large thin round, roughly 10 inches across. ",

This makes it very easy to scrub the skins, eliminating the need to peel them and lose those nutrients. After scrubbing, pat them dry and cut them into approximately \u00be\" cubes. Be careful where you cut them, as they can stain (purple potato juice!). Put them in a mixing bowl. Wash, trim, and slice the green onions. Add to potatoes. Finely chop the garlic and add to potatoes. Wash and cut up the cayenne pepper or red peppers to taste. I like fairly large hunks of sweet red pepper. Add salt, pepper, and pepper powder to taste. Spray a little bit of pam or other cooking spray in a non-stick roasting pan. Bake in a 400 \u00b0F oven for approximately \u00bd hour. This time will vary with the size and amount of the potato pieces. Stir occasionally while baking. I have found that ensuring that they lie in a single layer works the best and yields a crispy, not soggy, crust on the potatoes.",

It takes practice -- cook too long and the coating will be granular; cook not long enough and it'll be sticky.

Note: i use a pizza stone or fire bricks that i purchased from a masonry supply house after i broke my pizza stone. Leftover slices always crisp up nicely in the toaster oven the next day for lunch. Sprinkle yeast over the water and stir gently until dissolved. Should be a smooth and beige-colored mixture. If not, throw it out and start again - check the expiration date on the yeast package. Put in a warm spot for about 5 minutes (i set it in the microwave). Put 3 cups of the flour and all the salt in a mixing bowl, stir together. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture. Stir from the middle, mixing in flour from the sides just until a soft dough forms. Turn dough out onto floured surface. Dust your hands with flour and knead gently. Gradually add the remaining \u00bc cup of flour until dough is no longer sticky or tacky - about 5 minutes. As you knead, scrape up bits of dough that stick to the work surface with a metal dough scraper. Knead 10-15 minutes until dough is smooth, elastic, and shiny. Knead only until smooth and springy. (overdoing it makes a tough crust). Shape dough into a ball and put in clean bowl (note: don\"t use a cold bowl ~ rinse out with warm water and wipe dry). Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and put in draft-free warm place (75-85 \u00b0F). It will double in size after about an hour - takes 1-\u00bd hours at lower temperatures. Press the air bubbles out of the dough (don\"t \"punch\" it - be gentle). Gently shape into a round ball. Let rest for 10 minutes. I cover it with the inverted mixing bowl so that it doesn\"t dry out. Roll or stretch out into pizza shape, cover with favorite toppings and bake at a high temperature. If i am going to use especially moist toppings, i precook the crust for 5-10 minutes. Makes a 15-16 inch pizza. Or divide dough into two equal pieces for two 12-inch round flat pizzas. Or divide into 18 equal-size portions for 3-inch appetizer sized pizzas. Use within 2 hours. Or press out air bubbles again, shape into round ball, put in bowl covered with plastic wrap, and set in refrigerator. Refrigerate up to 24 hours. Let it come to room temperature before using. Will freeze nicely - wrap tightly in plastic and freeze up to 4 months. Before using, thaw in refrigerator 1-2 days or a few hours at room temperature",

Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until most of the tomato liquid has been absorbed by the potatoes (this takes anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, and is usually dependent on how hungry you are). Optional: if you want to add eggs at this point, make a crater in the center of the pan and add eggs. Continue cooking over medium heat until eggs are scrambled. When they are just about down, stir thoroughly with the potato mixture. Serve with cheese (optional), either alone, or wrapped in steamed tortillas. With the eggs and cheese, this make a simple, spicy, and very filling breakfast. Other ideas I have yet to try: stir in spinach, zucchini, mushrooms, and or onions with the potatoes.",

Add one tablespoon of water and let is soften. Add the boiling water to the gelatin mixture. Stir it with a fork for several minutes, to dissolve the gelatin completely. Let it sit and cool down some. Meanwhile measure the oil, vanilla and lemon juice all into a small container. Set it aside. Also measure the Granulated sugar or Sugar and set aside. When the water in the freezer has ice crystals forming on it, take it out and place it on the counter. Pour in a full cup of dry milk powder. Using electric beaters, whip the mixture at high speed until it forms stiff peaks. This will take a full five minutes. Continue beating, and gradually add the Granulated sugar or Sugar. When it is fully incorporated, gradually add the cooled gelatin mixture. When this is fully incorporated, gradually add the oil, vanilla, lemon juice mixture, in a small stream. The texture of the topping will change a little bit, becoming bright white and creamier. This is normal. Now place the bowl into the freezer again for about 10 or 15 minutes. It will chill and thicken. Stir it with a wire whisk right before serving. You may serve it right away, or keep it in the fridge for a few days. Be sure to stir it before serving, because it tends to thicken up while it sits. Stirring it will make it creamy again. It doesn't taste the same as the non-dairy whipped toppings you find at the supermarket. It actually tastes much better. The dry milk powder gives it a dairy flavor which, is much more satisfying than the chemical fluff available in the freezer at the market. It is economical to make compared to purchasing ready made. Serve it anywhere you would regular whipped topping, and even use it in fancy pudding or gelatin creations. It holds up nicely. Great as a topping for cream Pies. If you are trying to cut down on cholesterol, this recipe will work as well as real light whipping cream or whipping cream on most deserts.",
