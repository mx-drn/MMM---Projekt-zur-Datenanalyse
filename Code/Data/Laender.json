Dump the chopped-up leaves into a large-ish pan one-third full of boiling water on the stove. Boil the leaves for about 45 minutes on a semi-agressive simmer After about 45 mins of semi-agressive simmering - use a magi-mix blender to \u201czap\u201d the mixture in 5 or six very-short bursts in order to break-down the coarse, stewing ribbons of leaf into more finely shredded bits: After another 20 minutes of simmering - give the mixture a good stir - Put two heaped dessert-spoons of maize-flour (polenta/cornmeal) into a glass and then add some water from the tap. Give it a good stir - ensuring that there are no lumps - and then add to the simmering saag mixture. Let it simmer for a few minutes - and then chop a generous knob of butter and add to the pot - stirring until melted. You will especially enjoy the fact that at this point - the saag is not simmering as such - instead large bubbles start to form just below the surface of the mixture - and erupt like mini-volcanoes - making a gloopy sound - and splattering your kitchen in a 2 metre radius around the pot. So make sure that you keep a lid handy - just haf-covering the pot so that some of the water evaporates and thickens the mixture. Simmer like this gently for another half-hour - stirring occasionally - and then turn off the heat after it has reached your desired consistency. Then get another small pot - put in a little oil - heat up and then add onions. Fry until the onions are slightly golden-brown. Then add the ginger, garlic and chillie. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the smell of it all spreads across the kitchen. Then add the spices to the browned onions: 2 teaspoons salt, 3 teaspoons turmeric, 3 teaspons garam masala, two teaspoons ground coriander. By now - the special aroma will be wafting its way out of your kitchen and into your garden - and from there - onwards into the kitchens of your next door neighbours. They will be envious. Then add the onion-spice mixture to the saag pot - and stir until well mixed: Then - when you are ready to eat - heat-up the completed saag until it\u2019s just about to boil - serve into a bowl and accompany with either fresh roti - or naan bread (or pitta bread) and a fresh salad of chopped cucumber, halves of cherry tomato, chunky strips of carrot, halves of small radish, and chunkily-chopped red-Onion - all tossed in a few dashes of tangy vinegar. Simply delicious! If there\u2019s any saag remaining in the pot - just put it away into a microwaveable container with a lid - and store in your fridge. It will keep for around 2 days. Just take out of fridge at any time and put container in microwave for a few minutes of reheat - stirring and reheating until piping hot. You can even store in freezer - and will keep for weeks like that. Just make sure you defrost for a few hours before attempting to reheat in microwave.",

Fry nigella or kalonji seeds and whole green chilies for a few seconds, then add Onion and fry until it is richly browned but not burnt. Add chopped chile pepper or green chile, turmeric, salt, Granulated sugar or Sugar and tomatoes. Simmer, covered, until tomatoes disintegrate into sauce, about 10 minutes. Add the Eggplant and simmer, covered, at least 10 minutes to blend flavours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove from heat. Let stand 15 minutes to help develop flavours. Add cilantro & green onions. Mix and serve. Like most Indian dishes, this is one that improves drastically with age. I usually make it the day before the meal & then reheat just before serving.",

There is no need to form a cube as you will be mashing it after.  Drain for a half hour. In a large pan, mash the paneer till you have kneaded into a smooth dough.  This should take around 10 minutes. The softer you make it, the better the end result.  Spread the paneer into as fine a layer as possible, sprinkle the flour over the surface of paneer and knead well to mix it thoroughly. Let this kneaded dough rest for a few minutes.  In a deep pan, maybe even a large pressure cooker, bring the 7 cups of water to a boil with the Granulated sugar or Sugar, bay leaf and cardamom pod in it.  Bring the liquid to a boil, no more then 4 minutes, and then reduce to a very low flame to keep warm. To make the soaking syrup, bring the water to a boil with the Granulated sugar or Sugar, bay leaf, and cardamom.  Boil for no more than 5 minutes and then turn the flame off. Add the scented water and keep this warm. Take some of the Cheese and make balls around 1 inch in diameter. Your goal should be to make around 2 dozen such balls. Make a depression in each of these balls with your finger and place a Granulated sugar or Sugar cube in each of these.  Reshape into a smooth ball with no cracks at all.  Raise heat for the soaking syrup, and bring it to a gentle simmer that is bubbling but not boiling.  To this add the milk balls very carefully. You can even do this by putting them onto spoons and dropping them gently into the syrup. Cover the container once all the balls are placed into the syrup.  Cook in this simmering syrup for about a half hour. The balls should have expanded in size and look more opaque. Remove these from this simmering syrup with a slotted spoon and gently place each of these into the soaking scented syrup. Once you have placed all of these into the syrup, let the syrup and the balls cool, and then cover and chill overnight.  These will taste much better once the flavors have melded into the Cheese balls.  The soaking in the syrup also makes the spongy balls become a little softer.",

If you have to proof the yeast first (I don't) then proof it in a little warm water with some of the Granulated sugar or Sugar. If using an electric mixer with a dough hook, start kneading the dough while slowly adding warm water, a little at a time, until you get a pliable, but slightly sticky dough. You don't want the dough to be stiff enough to pick up and throw at someone (don't laugh, it's been done before), but at the same time, you don't want the dough to be so gloopy you have to dish it out with a spoon. You want this to have a little substance, but still still to the bowl a bit, and to your hands. If you are working by hand, just read the above directions, but forget about the dough hook. First use a good, heavy wooden spoon, then start working and kneading with your hands. Let the dough rise until doubled. If you don't have enough patience for this, a good zap in the microwave for 30 seconds on high every 15 minutes or so should give that dough a good burst of energy. When the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down (feels good, doesn't it), wipe the sticky dough off your hands, and let it rise until doubled again. Punch it down again. Pour about two inches of oil in a pot that's suitable for deep frying. I used a smallish pot and fried the zalabia two at a time. Pinch off a ping-pong ball-sized piece of dough. Shape it into a ball and then with your fingers, poke a hole and shape the dough into a doughnut. Fry in the hot oil, first on one side, then on the other, until golden brown. Be careful, they brown quickly. Drain on absorbant paper towels, and dredge with powdered sugar.Comment:",

To make the meringue, combine flour and cashews in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Process until the nuts are finely chopped; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on high speed until stiff only but not dry. Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix up the flour-nut mixture gradually. Arrange the round molds on the prepared cookie sheet. Pipe mixture into the molds or spread evenly using an offset spatula. Bake for 15 minutes or until lightly golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes before removing from the molds. Set aside. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make a total of about 40 meringue discs. Place 20 meringue discs and any broken discs in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Process to make crumbs. Transfer to a shallow bowl and set aside. To make the buttercream: Combine sugar and water in a saucepan. Boil until it reaches 238\u00b0 F. Meanwhile, combine the egg yolks and the whole egg in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Whip on high speed for about 10 minutes or until the mixture forms a ribbon pattern when the paddle is lifted. The mixture should be pale yellow. Just add salt. When the sugar syrup has reached its desired temperature, carefully pour the boiling syrup into the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream. Whip continuously on high speed until the mixture has cooled and the bowl is cool to the touch. Lower the mixer's speed to medium. Gradually add butter, 1 cube at a time. The mixture might look broken and curdled. Whip a little longer and the mixture will come together. Once smooth, add vanilla extract. To assemble, spread about 1 to 2 tablespoons buttercream on one side of a meringue disc. Cover with another meringue disc to make a sandwich. Spread buttercream all over the sandwich to cover all surfaces, including the sides. Roll the ''silvanas'' in meringue crumbs, then refrigerate or freeze until the buttercream is firm. Serve cold and plain or with other desserts. Sell per piece, if desired.",
