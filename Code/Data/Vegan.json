Turn heat up to 190 \u00b0C and fry until golden and crunchy. In a deep skillet with a good lid (I use a wok) heat the olive oil. Fry onions untill they have wilted on a high heat, then turn down the heat and cover. Peel your garlic (bash it with the flat of a good kitchen knife and\"top'n' tail\") and chop into smallish pieces (if you'r going to serve this to kids put it through a food processor, if you like garlic just cut it into rounds). Add to the onions and turn the heat up again. Chop your red chile pepper or chilli pepper very very carefully into really tiny pieces, add to the pan and WASH YOUR HANDS! I mean it! go wash'em and then come back! Throw in your peppers and your spices, you'll have to experiment with this, because I love my papas to be real spicy, I add about 2 tsp tabasco, a good Tbsp pepper and then a liberal amount of Cayenne to give that extra colour and flavour. Mix the water, soy sauce, vinegar and Granulated sugar or Sugar and stir into the pan. Reduce for a bit, you should end up with something thick and gooey that looks unappetizing, sort of chutney consistency. Cut up your tomatoes into eighths and put into the mixture. They WILL desintegrate. Just before serving, and I do mean just, toss the potatoes in this jam/chutney you have just made. It looks, ummm, not too pleasent, but it tastes great. If you have left overs, refrigerate and then when you want to use it shape them into a sort of\"patty\" by mashing the potatos a bit, then either fry in oil or\"dry-fry\" them in a large pan. ",

Fear not! 2 cups of rice will indeed absorb 7 cups of liquid. The rice will begin to release starch and the whole mixture will take on a creamy consistency. Once all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is al dente, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chopped basil, the nutritional yeast, the last 2 tbsp margarine, and salt and pepper to taste.

A small deep dish is best - large enough to hold all breasts and still leave about an inch or two open space at top).  Place Chicken breasts into dish, adding Teriyaki sauce between breasts to coat.  Sprinkle lightly with pepper.  Let marinade stand for 1/2 hour, turning breasts about every 5 to 10 minutes. If you let the breasts stand in the marinade too long the flavor becomes too harsh. Too short and you won't get the Teriyaki flavor.  Remove breasts from marinade (save marinade) and place cut-side up on medium-high grill (either charcoal or gas), cover and let cook for eight (8) minutes.  Turn breasts over, lightly coat with marinade, and let cook an additional seven (7) minutes.  Remove breasts to cutting board and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes. This will ensure the Chicken will cook all the way through, yet still remain moist.  Slice the breasts length-wise into strips about 1/2 inch wide. If the Chicken is thick, rotate the strip and cut again to create smaller strips",

Add the garlic, the tomatoes together with their liquid, the basil and the wine. Let the mixture simmer gently without a lid on the pan, stirring from time to time, until the liquid has disappeared and it is quite thick - this will take about 20 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for a further 5 minutes or so, or until the mushrooms are tender and any liquid which they make has boiled away. Remove from the heat and season to taste. When the filling mixture has cooled, you can assemble the strudel, which can then be cooked straight away, or kept in the fridge for a few hours until you\"re ready, or in the freezer for at least a month. I find it easiest to assemble the studel directly on to a large baking sheet, which means you don't have to lift it later.

If you have the type which is quite large \u2014 about 30 cm (12 inches) or so square \u2014 lay out one sheet. Either way, brush the surface with a little melted butter and then sprinkle with a third of the nuts. Put another layer of phyllo or filo pastry on top, brush with butter, and scatter with nuts. Repeat with another layer, then a final layer of phyllo or filo pastry, which you just brush with butter. Now tip the tomato filling mixture on top and spread it to about 2.5 cm (1 inch) of the edges. Fold the edges over, to enclose the edge of the filling then, starting from one of the widest edges, roll the whole thing up like a Swiss roll, trying not to let it break (although it's not the end of the world if it does). Brush with melted butter and garnish with some shreds or shapes of phyllo or filo pastry. Put the strudel into the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.

Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, about 3 hours. Cut twenty-four 6-inch squares of wax paper. Roll out 1 piece of dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap into 12-inch round (about 1/8 inch thick). Cut out 6 rounds with a 5-inch round cutter, sandwiching each round between 2 squares of wax paper, and stack on a baking sheet. If dough becomes to soft to work with, transfer it to a baking sheet and chill until firm. Roll out and cut remaining piece of dough in same manner, sandwiching rounds between remaining squares of wax paper, and stack on baking sheet. Chill rounds until firm and wrap each stack carefully with plastic wrap to prevent drying. Dough may be made 1 day ahead and chilled. Make filling: In a heavy saucepan whisk together Granulated sugar or Sugar, cornstarch, and salt and gradually whisk in water and milk until cornstarch is dissolved. In a bowl whisk together egg yolk or yolks. Cook milk mixture over moderate heat, whisking, until it comes to a boil. Gradually whisk about 1/2 cup hot milk mixture into egg yolk or yolks and whisk yolk mixture into remaining hot milk mixture. Bring custard to a slow boil, whisking, 1 minute. Remove pan from heat and whisk in butter, lemon juice, and zest until butter is melted. Cover surface of filling with plastic wrap. Filling may be made 1 day ahead and chilled. Do not stir filling or it will break down. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F, and lightly butter 2 baking sheets. Discard top square of wax paper from 1 dough round and spoon 1 tablespoon filling onto center of round. Using wax paper fold dough over to form a half circle, enclosing filling, and press edges together lightly. Transfer pie to baking sheet, discarding paper, and crimp edge with a fork. Prick pie with fork once. Make 11 more pies with remaining dough rounds and filling. Bake pies in 2 batches in middle of oven 15 minutes, or until golden brown around edges (dough will crack open slightly), and transfer to racks to cool. Pies may be made 4 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Serve pies chilled or at room temperature (do not let pies stand more than 30 minutes at room temperature).",

To prepare the stuffing: put the butter and olive oil in a large heavy saute pan, or better yet, a kettle, and place it over moderate heat. When the butter is melted, add the garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes until limp. Meanwhile, tear the bread into small chunks. Add the bread and the fine salt and pepper and toss well. Pour in the chicken stock and beat hard with a wooden spoon until the mixture is pastelike. Turn the heat to its lowest point, cover the kettle and steam 15-to-20 minutes until the bread absorbs all the liquid. Add the egg yolks to the stuffing mixture and beat hard until smooth. Remove from the heat and reserve. Preheat oven to 400 \u00b0F. Drain the Turkey and rinse several times in cool water so that all traces of salt are gone. Place the bird on the counter with the neck cavity facing you. With your hands, begin working the skin free from the breast. Proceed gently, taking care not to tear the skin. It\"s slow going at first, but once you begin to free the skin, the job goes quickly. Loosen it all the way down the bird to within about 1 inch of the tail end, down both sides. With your hands, push the stuffing bit by bit far down under the skin and continue, packing it in lightly, until the breast is covered with about a 1-inch layer. Next fill the neck cavity, skewer the neck skin flat against the back to enclose, and truss the bird. Place the Turkey breast-side up in a large shallow roasting pan without a rack and roast uncovered for about 2 \u00bd hours. Do not baste. When the bird is richly browned and a leg moves easily in the hip joint, remove from the oven. Let stand, uncovered, 20 minutes. Drain drippings into a sauce boat and keep warm.

May be stored for several months in an airtight covered jar. Remove the giblets and neck, rinse the turkey meat or turkey well with cold water and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Take care to dry both inside cavities. Place in a large pan and rub the interior and exterior of the bird with seasoning mix. To allow for good oil circulation through the cavity, do not truss or tie legs together. Cut off the wing tips and plump little tail as they may get caught in the fryer basket. Cover pan and place in refrigerator overnight. Place the outdoor gas burner on a level dirt or grassy area. Never fry a turkey meat or turkey indoors, in a garage or in any structure attached to a building. Do not fry on wood decks, which could catch fire, or concrete, which could be stained by the oil ('''Safety tip''': have a fire extinguisher nearby for added safety)  Add oil to a 7 \u2013 10 gallon pot with a basket or rack. At the medium- high setting, heat the oil to 375\u00b0F, (depending on the amount of oil, outside temperature and wind conditions, this should take about 20 \u2013 40 minutes). Meanwhile, place the turkey meat or turkey in a basket or on a rack, neck down. When the deep-fry thermometer reaches 375\u00b0F slowly lower the turkey meat or turkey into the hot oil. The level of the oil will rise due to the frothing caused by the moisture from the turkey meat or turkey but will stabilize in about one minute ('''Safety tips''': to prevent burns from the splattering oil wear oven mitts/gloves, long sleeves, heavy shoes and even glasses. It is wise to have two people lowering and raising the turkey meat or turkey)  Immediately check the oil temperature and increase the flame so the oil temperature is maintained at 350\u00b0F. If the temperature drops to 340\u00b0F or below, oil will begin to seep into the turkey meat or turkey. Fry about 3 \u2013 4 minutes per pound, or about 35 \u2013 42 minutes for a 10 \u2013 12 pound turkey meat or turkey. Stay with the cooker at all times as the heat must be regulated. When cooked to 170\u00b0F in the breast or 180\u00b0F in the thigh, carefully remove the turkey meat or turkey from the hot oil. Allow the turkey meat or turkey to drain for a few minutes  ('''Safety tip''': allow the oil to cool completely before storing or disposing)  Remove turkey meat or turkey from the rack and place on a serving platter. Allow to rest for 20 minutes before carving.",

Heat a large casserole that can be used on the stove as well as in the oven, then add olive oil. When olive oil is heated and begins to smell fragrant, add the roast and brown on all sides, turning with a large fork several times. Remove the roast to a separate pan and reserve drippings.

Take note of the sinewy lines running straight along the\"long\" side of the meat- those are the grain lines. Take a large chef's knife and cut a very, very thin slice of meat off of the short end, as you do so you should be cutting through the grain lines (top to bottom) as if you were making a line through a grid or a tic-tac toe board- this should result in thin, short strips of meat (Cutting through the sinewy lines this way will produce tender meat.) Cut all of the meat into these thin, short strips and add them all to the marinade. Take a vegetable peeler and peel carrots (discard peels)- then using the veggie peeler, continue to\"peel\" off strips of the carrot meat until the carrots are all cut into long, wide thin strips- add to marinade and seal container and flip over a few times to make sure everything is coated. Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Drain meat and carrot strips,reserving the marinade into a small saucepan (don't worry is some of the green onions end up in the meat or the marinade- they will all get cooked eventually). Heat 1 tsp sesame oil in a large wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Stir fry half of the meat strips until just cooked through (maybe 5 minutes or so)- there may still be a little pink remaining- immediately remove to a covered dish to keep warm, then stir fry remaining beef (about another 5 minutes or so) and remove it to the same covered dish (Don't try to cook this all together or you will steam the meat and it will get too watery).  Add the marinade to the empty pan and bring to a boil,once it boils, let boil rapidly for 3 minutes to reduce sauce and kill off any bacteria. While it is reducing, portion out 1 cup cooked rice per serving (see TIP below) and divide meat& carrots among each plate. Drizzle reduced marinade over rice and meat and garnish with reserved raw green onion slices and a sprinkling of sesame seeds. TIP: You can use a small custard cup or even a 1 cup measuring scoop to form the rice into decorative portions-if you press the freshly cooked Jasmine rice (which is slightly sticky) into the bowl to fill it tightly, then flip it over onto the plate, when you remove the bowl, the rice will have taken the shape of the cup.",

This is necessary so that the butter does not run out while deep-frying. Secure chicken rolls with skewers or toothpicks. In a bowl, beat eggs with water. In a separate mixing bowl, mix together black pepper, garlic powder, dill or dill weed and flour. In another separate bowl, measure the bread crumbs. Completely coat each rolled chicken into the flour mixture. Dip flour coated chicken into the egg mixture. Now roll and coat the chicken in the bread crumbs. Place chicken in a shallow dish and chill for about 30 minutes. In a medium size frying pan, add vegetable oil and heat to medium-high heat. Carefully place the chicken rolls into the oil and cook for 5 minutes on each side or until chicken is done and golden brown. To test for doneness, cut into 1 rolled chicken to make sure no pink is showing. Serve immediately, garnished with lemon twists and parsley.",

In a large storage bag, put in one-half cup of flour, a half teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoon of pepper (or to taste). Shake the combination until well mixed. Now, one at a time, add the chicken breasts. Shake them until they're coated with flour. Set each one aside as you've coated it. Toss out any leftover coating mixture. Depending on how big your chicken breasts are, it might even take a bit more flour. Heat the vegetable oil on medium high and add the chicken breasts, breast-side down first. Saute until that side of the chicken is golden brown. This should take just a few minutes. Turn over and lightly brown the underside of the chicken breast. Remove the chicken from the saute pan and put it in an ovenproof dish. Do not wash out the saute pan! Put the chicken in the oven at 400 degrees to finish the chicken by roasting it. This should take no more than 20 minutes to a half hour. While the chicken is in the oven, you are going to finish your sauce. Use the same pan that has the drippings in it. With the stove burner turned off, deglaze the pan by pouring in the vodka. Do not do this with the burner on or you'll risk singing your eyebrows or worse! Use a wooden spoon to scrape up the bits in the bottom of the pan. Add the chicken broth and the lemon juice. You'll want to reduce this mixture by about 25%. Do not do this on medium high heat. Then add the tomatoes and the heavy cream. Turn to medium low. You are just trying to get the sauce to start to thicken up. Stir often. When the sauce is finished, turn off the burner if the chicken is not ready yet. You can re-heat the sauce in a few minutes when the chicken is finished. To test your chicken, you can cut a small slice into it; if the juices run clear and you don't see pink, you're ready to go. Put the chicken on the plate. Spoon sauce on top and then sprinkle with the green onion pieces for color. If you are serving the dish with potatoes and a veggie, you can sprinkle the whole plate with the onions.",

Scrape away some of the flesh, especially around the top, to form a large, smooth inner cavity. Make sure to leave the shell at least 1-inch thick all around. Oil the pumpkin inside and out and season inside with salt and pepper. Replace the lid. Place on a baking sheet and bake until about \u2154 cooked but still firm enough to stand and act as the soup container, about 40 minutes. Do not over-bake. If a good deal of liquid gathers in the bottom, spoon out and discard. Set aside; it will stay warm on its own for a good while. Bring the stock to a low simmer in a saucepan. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the onion and cook until soft but not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the thyme, stir, and add the pastina. Stir and add 2 cups of heated stock. Bring the mixture up to a simmer. Simmer, adding the stock \u00bd cup at a time as the previous addition is absorbed and stirring occasionally to prevent the pastina from sticking to the bottom of the pan, until the pasta is al dente, about 15 minutes. Add the roasted squash and turkey to reheat. Stir well. The consistency should be quite loose, like a thick soup. Add more stock, if necessary. Add the \u00bd cup cheese and let melt for a moment before stirring in. Taste for seasoning. Fill the reserved pumpkin shell with the pastina. Grate Parmesan on top and replace the lid and take to the table immediately. You could also serve this in individual tureens using smaller pumpkins or acorn squash.",

Removing the saponins helps with digestion; the soapy nature of the compound makes it act as a laxative. Most boxed quinoa has been pre-rinsed for convenience, but check your box carefully before deciding you don't need to rinse the quinoa. Heat olive oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until soft, stirring constantly. Add garlic and quinoa and continue stirring a minute or two. Stir in broth and milk. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until quinoa is tender, stirring occasionally, about 10-12 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook another 3-5 minutes, stirring often. Remove from heat.

Process to make crumbs. Transfer to a shallow bowl and set aside. To make the buttercream: Combine sugar and water in a saucepan. Boil until it reaches 238\u00b0 F. Meanwhile, combine the egg yolks and the whole egg in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Whip on high speed for about 10 minutes or until the mixture forms a ribbon pattern when the paddle is lifted. The mixture should be pale yellow. Just add salt. When the sugar syrup has reached its desired temperature, carefully pour the boiling syrup into the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream. Whip continuously on high speed until the mixture has cooled and the bowl is cool to the touch. Lower the mixer's speed to medium. Gradually add butter, 1 cube at a time. The mixture might look broken and curdled. Whip a little longer and the mixture will come together. Once smooth, add vanilla extract. To assemble, spread about 1 to 2 tablespoons buttercream on one side of a meringue disc. Cover with another meringue disc to make a sandwich.
