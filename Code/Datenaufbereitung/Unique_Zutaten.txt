* pita bread 

* 3 cups of white long [[cereals|grain]] [[rice]]

* 4 tablespoons cooking [[oil]]

* 3-4 medium [[potato]]es

* 4 ounces [[water]]

== ==

 == When the [[rice]] is half-crunchy half-soft, take it out and drain it in a kitchen strainer. ==

* Run tap [[water]] on top of it to wash out some of the [[salt]].

* Pour the [[oil]] in the pot, add 4 oz of [[water]].

* Lay the [[potato]]es in the bottom of the pot, add a bit of [[salt]], then pile up the [[rice]] loosely in the shape of a mountain, on top of the [[potato]]es.

* With the back of a spoon, make five holes, one in the center and four around it so that the [[rice]] can breath in the cooking process.

* == Directions ==

** For best results, soak the [[rice]] for a few hours in hot [[water]] and some [[salt]] before cooking.

** Peel the [[potato]]es and slice them in a round shape.

** You could use the [[potato]]es unpeeled as well since they add lots of fiber to your diet (I don't do this, I have picky kids).

** In a medium size pot, half-way filled with [[water]], bring the [[water]] to a boil.

** Add the [[rice]] (and the [[water]] it was soaking in), and let it cook for a few minutes until it starts boiling.

** Occasionally pick a few of the [[rice]] [[grains]] with a spoon and chew on them to see if they have softened.

<p style="text-align:right">Spread a little [[water]] on top and close the lid.</p>

* Let it cook for a couple of minutes on high heat.

* When the [[rice]] starts to steam, change the setting to medium heat and let it cook for about 15 minutes.

* Then turn the heat to medium-low, sprinkle some cooking [[oil]] to stop it from drying, and let it cook for another 10 minutes.

* Most likely by this time the smell of the [[potato]]es has filled the kitchen, and the dish is ready to eat.

* Note: If you have a choice, use [[basmati rice]] and be careful not to overboil, it can get pretty sticky if you overcook it.

* 48 freshly shucked oysters

* 1 1/2 cups oyster broth, i.e., the liquid inside the oyster shells

* 2 sticks butter (1/2 cup)

* 1/4 cup finely chopped green onions

* 1 1/2 cups finely chooped celery

* 1/2 tsp black pepper

* 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley

* 5 Tablespoons white flour, sifted

* 3 1/2 cups whole milk

For 4 persons:

* 1 medium chicken

* 1 medium rabbit

* 2 medium ripe chopped tomatoes

* 165 grs. wide green bean (spanish-bachoqueta)

* 130 grs. large white lima beans (spanish-garrafon)

* 1 level teaspoon of saffron

* 3 cups of spanish rice

* 8 cups of hot water or (even better chicken broth)

* Olive oil (enough to cover the bottom of the paella pan)

* Salt (to taste)

* 1 level teaspoon of sweet red paprika

=== Method ===

# Heat the oil and when it is hot enough, add the rabbit and chicken (lightly salted) and fry unitl lightly browned.

# Then add the white and green beans and cook them together with the meat.

# While they are cooking, make a clearance in the middle of the paella pans and fry the chopped tomatoes until they look a little pasty, quickly adding the paprika, stirring quickly and immediately adding the hot water or broth until it is almost to the top of the paella pans edge.

# Cook all the ingredients for about 20 minutes over a high fire and tasting for salt.

# After 20 minutes we add the rice, distributing it evenly, making sure the rice is covered with liquid.

# The fire should be fairly high, not interrupting the boil. It takes about 20 minutes for the paella rice to cook. Do not stir the rice once you have added it to the paella pans, just change its position so that the fire gets to all patrs equally. All the broth should be absorbed when finished.

# Take the paella off the fire and let stand for about 10 minutes covering the top with newspaper. If the rice has been cooked correctly, the rice grains should be loose, not clumped together or having a mushy texture.

== Serving ==

For a fantastic table presentation, small wedges of lemon can decorate the border and branches of romero (aromatic herbs) in the middle. Now you are ready to dig into your paella with wooden spoons and eat directly from the paela pans!

In other regions and even in some of the best recipes, you will that peas and peppers are added. These are not authentic ingredients for a true Valencian paella recipe.

=== The Paella in the video ===

==== Ingrediets ====

* Bottarga, close-shaved

* 1 Arthur Legg-Bourke chicken, jointed

* 1 gullet of New Zealand fat-lip mussels

* Italian risotto riz, 235 gms

* 1 southern Spanish onion

* Garlic, two bulbcloves

* 4 Italian flat-chested plum tomatoes

* Piselli, molto

* Saffron, pinche

* Red pepper, nuded

* 1 carrot, tapered

* A stique of celery

* 6 Madagascan king of king prawns

==== Method ====

# Brush fat lips mussels several times over to strike their little beards. Put the mussels with their jus in hot bubbled water and thrill for two minutes.

# For the stock, use stock cubes. Otherwise, pillage the bones from your bone bowl. Bury them in a pan with some gale-forced, condimentalised celery and carrot. Hot-bubble the bones for around six hours.

# Put chicken, garlic, onion, tomatoes, pepper, peas and saffron in hot slow virgin oil.

# Plus-add the risotto, embarrassed mussels and king of king prawns, gently gushing the stock till it obsesses the risotto.

# Add red pepper. Leave for three minutes to let the ingredients talk amongst themselves. Then add the close-shaved bottarga.

# Shroud the pan in recycled aluminium foil and put it in the stove, 150 degrees, for about 45 to 46 minutes. When it's done, let it settle for a good ten minutes.

* 1 cup Butter

* 1 cup Powdered Sugar

* 2 3/4 cup Flour

* 3 T finely chopped Rosemary

* 1 T Lemon rind.

SERVINGS: MAKES 36

* 1½ cups gluten-free all-purpose flour

* ¼ cup arrowroot

* 1½ teaspoons xanthan gum

* 1 teaspoon baking soda

* 1 cup organic sugar

* ¾ cup virgin coconut oil, warmed, slightly cooled

* ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder

* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

* ½ cup unsweetened applesauce

* 1 cup vegan chocolate chips

* 2 tablespoons mint extract

=== Preparation ===

* Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 325°. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.

* Whisk flour, arrowroot, xanthan gum, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Using a rubber spatula, mix coconut oil, cocoa powder, salt, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in dry ingredients until combined, then stir in applesauce.

* Using a small ice cream scoop or spoon, scoop balls of dough (about the size of a small lime) onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 2" apart. Using the back of your hand or the spoon, flatten balls into ½"-thick rounds. Bake cookies, rotating once halfway through, until edges are set (cookies will firm as they cool), 12–15 minutes. Transfer parchment with cookies onto wire racks to cool.

* Meanwhile, stir chocolate chips and mint extract in a medium heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (water should not touch bowl) until melted and smooth (or heat in a microwave in 10-second increments and stir until smooth).

* Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper (you can use the same sheets you baked on; either refresh the parchment or flip it over). Once cookies are cooled, dip tops of cookies into chocolate glaze and place on prepared sheet. Chill cookies to firm them up, at least 15 minutes.

* Do Ahead: Cookies can be stored in the freezer for up to 1 week.

[[File:Matcha-white-chocolate-sugar-cookies-940x600.jpg|thumb|436x436px|(*0ε<艸★) <—(MWAH! fangirl)]]

* ¾ cup granulated sugar, divided

* ½ teaspoon plus 2 Tbsp. matcha

* 2 cups all-purpose flour

* ¾ teaspoon baking soda

* ½ teaspoon kosher salt

* 1 cup (2 sticks) plus 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces, room temperature

* ½ cup (packed) light brown sugar

* 1½ tablespoons honey

* 1 large egg yolk

* 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest

* 3 ounces white chocolate, chopped

=== Ingredient Info ===

* Matcha, also called green tea powder, is available at Japanese markets and some supermarkets, and online.

* Whisk ½ cup granulated sugar and ½ tsp. matcha in a small bowl; set aside.

* Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and remaining 2 Tbsp. matcha in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, brown sugar, honey, and remaining ¼ cup granulated sugar in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg, egg yolk, and lemon zest and mix until very pale, about 4 minutes.

* Reduce mixer speed to low and, with motor running, add flour mixture; mix until no dry spots remain. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, mix in white chocolate.

* Wrap dough in plastic and chill at least 2 hours and up to 5 days. If chilling more than a few hours, let dough sit at room temperature 1 hour to soften before scooping and baking.

* Preheat oven to 350°. Scoop the dough by the scant tablespoonful onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 1” apart. (Or, for neat and tidy cookies with perfect edges, like the ones in our photo, portion same amount of dough into the cups of a mini muffin pan coated with nonstick vegetable oil spray.)

* Bake cookies, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until bottoms and edges are barely golden and cooked (top will no longer look wet), 8–10 minutes.

* Immediately—but gently—toss cookies in reserved matcha sugar and place on wire racks; let cool.

* Do Ahead: Store cookies airtight at room temperature up to 2 days.

== OMG!★ MY NEW FAVORITE DISH! ==

Yakitori is such awesome skewered food, it circles the sun annually.

This one is made from chicken and scallions for a magical savory and spicy flavor! Your life isn't complete without these tasty sticks of meat!

== Preparation for some Awesomeness ==

[[File:Chicken-and-scallion-yakitori 646.jpg|thumb|425x425px]]

SERVINGS: 4

* 1/2 cup low-salt chicken stock

* 1 cup mirin

* 1 cup soy sauce

* 1/2 cup sake

* 1 tablespoon (packed) light brown sugar

* 2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts

* 6 scallions, white and light-green parts only, cut into 1” pieces

* Kosher salt

* Vegetable oil, for brushing

* Combine chicken stock, mirin, soy sauce, sake, sugar, and 1/2 cup water in a small pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sauce is reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Let cool.

* Meanwhile, thinly slice chicken lengthwise along the grain. Working with one wooden skewer at a time, fold a piece of chicken onto itself and thread onto skewer. Repeat with more chicken pieces until skewer is half filled. Repeat with remaining chicken. Using separate skewers, pierce scallion pieces through the middle and thread them onto skewers until each skewer is half filled. Season chicken and scallions with salt.

* Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Brush grates with oil. Arrange skewers side by side on the grill so that they just touch; grill, turning every minute or so, until chicken and scallions are almost cooked through, about 2 minutes. Brush with reserved sauce. Cook until lightly charred and cooked through, about 2 more minutes. Serve with brown rice and sliced cucumbers, if desired.

You probably already have bread, cream cheese, and sugar, (maybe you even have nonpareils for those weekly, or daily, sundaes…) so why not throw ’em together and treat yo’self?

== ''Whip up some rich and creamy chocolate deliciousness in less than 5 minutes.'' ==

[[File:Double Choco Peanut Butter Spread.jpg|thumb|220x220px|'''''Is there anything that orbits the sun 'butter' than Choco Peanut Butter? Yes, peanut butter is also an octave of the sun.''''']]

It’s nearing the end of the semester and things are winding down as you finish your final assignments and exams. The excitement from the beginning of the year is gone, replaced by a strong yearning to go back to a place of comfort, familiar faces, and most importantly, good food.

Alas, we’re not there just yet. However, we have just the right thing to tide you over until you reach the coveted homeland: An incredibly simple and delicious double chocolate peanut butter spread. Did we say double chocolate and peanut butter in the same sentence? Yes, yes we did.

Skip the store-bought spread to whip up an easy and delicious alternative in the comfort of your own home. Pair this rich and creamy dip with honey graham crackers and assorted fruit for a sweet dessert or salty pretzels for a delicious contrast of flavors. Or better yet, eat it straight out of the bowl with a spoon. We’re not judging.

* ¼ cup honey or maple syrup

# Place chocolate chips and milk in a heat-safe bowl.

# Microwave for 15 seconds first, then in 5 second intervals if the chocolate hasn’t melted enough. Mix together to create luxurious, melted chocolate.

# [[File:Double Choco Peanut Butter Spreadstep3.jpg|thumb|220x220px|'''''There's nothing that orbits the sun 'butter' than this creamy, chocolaty and sticky masterpiece of mine. I AM GOD, FOR I HAVE CREATED AN OCTAVE OF OUR SUN!''''']]Combine all the ingredients together in a medium bowl. Enjoy your double chocolate peanut butter dip with whatever you prefer.

<em>#SpoonTip: Instead of stirring, try folding the mixture together in order to create a lighter, whipped texture.</em>

# Let's orbit the sun with the butter!

# YOU ARE GOD NOW, FOR YOU'VE MADE AN OCTAVE OF THE SUN WITH HONEY, CHOCOLATE, PEANUT BUTTER AND MILK... GOOD WORK, YOU! YOU'VE MADE IT TO CHOCOLATE HEAVEN!!!

__________________________________________________

Raisins have a long shelf life and are great for a boost of energy. I was walking on a cold boardwalk, quite a ways from home, when a pang of hunger attacked. I was wearing my ski jacket-an ideal jacket for the beach in the winter and also ideal for storage with its plentiful pockets for goggles, headphones, keys, money, credit cards, lip balm, sunblock, and Starburst. There are always a few raisins tucked away somewhere (long pocket life?), too; same in this recipe-hidden and sweetly surprising.

[[File:Cauliflower-melts.jpg|thumb|321x321px]]

== Let's Make These Babies! ==

== INGREDIENTS ==

#* 1/4 cup olive oil

#* 2 garlic cloves, minced

#* 1 teaspoon salt

#* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

#* Medium head of cauliflower, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slabs, possibly halved to make a total of 8 slabs

#* 1/2 cup golden raisins

#* 1/4 cup white wine (optional)

#* 1/4 cup shelled pistachios

#* 8 1/2-inch-thick slices sourdough bread

#* 4 ounces Comte or Manchego cheese, cut into 8 slices

#* 2 tablespoons chopped parsley

== PREPARATION ==

## 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

## 2. In a medium bowl, combine the oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Add the cauliflower slabs and toss to coat.

## 3. Arrange the cauliflower on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes, flip the slabs, and bake another 10 to 20 minutes, until softened and roasty. Set aside to cool but keep the oven on.

## 4. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, soak the raisins in wine or water for 10 minutes. Drain.

## 5. In a small pan over medium-high heat, toast the pistachios, dry or with a little oil. Let cool on a paper towel, then chop coarsely.

## 6. Lay the bread on the baking sheet and arrange the cauliflower on the bread, cutting it to fit as needed. Sprinkle with pistachios and raisins and top with the cheese.

## 7. Bake until the cheese melts, 7 to 10 minutes.

## 8. Top the toasts with chopped parsley and serve immediately.

I love BFDI, Zootopia, Gravity Falls, and Steven Universe. Why can't I just vote for all of them?

I love BFDI, Zootopia, Gravity Falls and Steven Universe... Also, I did NOT know how popular object shows were. I didn't expect the Yoyle Cake to survive two rounds.

Also you people should stop spamming "Yoyle Cake". I love BFDI and all, but it's really annoying.

Bill Cipher knows everything, but he doesn't know how delicious a yoyle cake is!

um actually

Diabetes Cake vs. Diabetes Popsicles

Diabetes Cola vs. Diabetes Breakfast. 

(That is if you eat all of those constantly everday)

I hate it when people hate a certain show/movie/book/comic etc. because of it's fandom (not that I like the SU fandom) . Steven Universe is a GREAT show but because of it's crazed fandom people who haven't actually watched the show will dislike it. Just try watching Steven Universe! Just ignore the fandom though.

@5 Below. Yoylecake Yoylecake '''YOYLECAKE! '''Ha!

no

OMG! THERE'S POINTS NOW! WHO'LL GO HOME!? WE'LL JUST SEE!

It's '''Yoylecake at Staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!!!!'''

Yoy!

[http://recipes.wikia.com/wiki/User:Trigger_Happy_the_Gremlin Trigger Happy the Gremlin] Agreed. I don't like Zootopia (Haven't seen it.) And Steven Universe ('''I ''DESPISE ''IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)'''

BFDI '''RULES! '''Steven Universe is '''S##T!'''

Yes.

Yoylecake vs. Not even Cold Popsicles

Armpit Cola vs. Good snacks turned vomit

I'll use my bulk shields!

'''\_______________________________________________________/'''

[http://recipes.wikia.com/wiki/User:Trigger_Happy_the_Gremlin Trigger Happy the Gremlin] Have to agree wit you for the SU thing. I wantched an episode and turned it off 2 minutes in. My record is 0 seconds.

Yes. It did crush almost anything it saw.

'''YOYOK!'''

Of joy for me!

Everyone yes, BFDI fans, for our other favorite shows, we must get... '''''REVENGE!'''''

Don't just vote for the fandom 

VOTE FOR THE FOOD ITSSELF

Someones spamming hilarious yet nasty photo

Hey this is comment number two thousand ninety-eight 

I'm too lazy too make it short 😝

You dislike something that you haven't seen.. Judging a book by it's cover much?

I love BFDI and Steven Universe, but to be honest..

Steven Universe is WAAAAAAAY better than BFDI.  You can't really argue with that.

[[File:Tumblr_nl57ygDdTg1up4talo4_500.gif|thumb|400px]]. 

Fine, Wiki Contributors. If somebody says Yoylecake five times in one sentence, they are a spammer. Please do not complain about this, or I will lower it back to twice!

"Not even Cold Popsicles" 

"Good snacks turned vomit"

I'm sorry I can't even..

TFW people hate a show but has barely watched a minute or even nothing at all.

You know what, if you are one of those arrogant poopouts calling Pitt Cola "Armpit Cola"... then suck yourz!

Then ignore the fandom, and watch the whole series. Trust me, it's a good show.

Last year there was Nuka Cola and Mabel Juice (which was a jelly I think)

The final four are sweets so Together Breakfast cannot be the only one that could give you "diabetes"

{{Infobox_Dish|name = Cake|type = Dessert|course = JUST EAT A SLICE YOU WANKER|origin = Your Crafting Table|ingredients = Sugar, Barley, Milk, Eggs|image = Venture Cake.jpg}}'''Cake '''is a soon to be added item in Venture. It was attempted to be entered in the Battle of the Fantasy Foods 2016.

== Recipe (Venture) ==

Crafting cake in Venture requires three barley stalks, three buckets of milk, two sugars, and an egg.

== Recipe (Reality) ==

Yet another recipe parodying the TOTALLY INACCURATE versions of the Fantasy Foods that win the battle:

* 1/2 cup white granulated sugar

* 6 tablespoons all purpose flour

* 1/4 teaspoon salt

* 2 1/2 cups milk

* 1 egg, whipped

* 1 tablespoon butter

* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

* 11-12 ripe cherries

* 1/4 cup lemon juice

** 1/2 cup heavy cream

** 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

** 1 1/2 teaspoons powdered sugar

=== Procedure 1. ===

# In the top of a double boiler, whisk together sugar, flour, salt and milk. Stir out any lumps.

# Bring water to boiling in lower portion of double boiler.

# Stir constantly until mixture is thickened, about 5-minutes.

# Place lid on mixture and continue cooking for 10 more minutes, stirring occasionally.

# Beat egg in a small bowl. Add about 1/2 cup of hot cake filling mixture to egg in bowl and stir well. This tempers the egg so it won't scramble when added to the hot cake filling.

# Pour tempered egg mixture into pan of hot cake filling. Stir constantly and cook for 2 more minutes.

# Remove from heat, add butter and vanilla. Stir until mixed.

# Chill for about 1 hour before adding topping.

# In a large bowl, whip cream with electric mixer until peaks are just forming.

# Beat vanilla and sugar into cream and continue mixing until peaks form in cream.

# Don't over beat the mixture or it will form lumps and begin to turn to butter.

# Spread whipped cream mixture over cake filling on chilled cake. Keep chilled until served.

# Garnish the cake with the cherries for in-game accuracy.

Go GF and BFD!!!!

If it is Pitt Cola vs. Yoylecake, PITT COLA!!!!

If it is TB vs. YC, YC!!

Resuming what has gone on the comment section so far:

- Yoylecake spam

- People attacking whoever votes against Yoylecake

- Regular comments

- "Ten minutes""One minute!!!

- People saying SU is cancer because of the fandom (Which is not true, SU is a good cartoon, but has that part of the fandom that is horrible)

- Seek Medical Help memes

- More Yylecake spam, along with Together Beakfast, Pitt Cola and Paws spam

i missed the butter sotch pie tho sill im a bfdi gravity falls and UNDERTALLE FAN

There's no use in telling the spammers to calm down, but they actaully are helping us since the SU fandom has almost no spam for Together Breakfast, making our fandom ( SU ) the least annoying. 

hey yoylecake fans go kys cause you can't shut up. pitt cola is going to beat you up

how about no

Together Breakfast all the way.

'''FIGHT ME'''

I want yoylecake to win. However that doesn't mean I hate the other foods. I'm not a big fan of SU or GF and it was BFDI vs Zootopia.

I find the GF falls community the least annoying sicne a lot of SU fans spam the Seek Medical Help thing

let yoylecake win actually. I'd like to see all the little kids raging that it actually doesn't turn you into metal in real life.

Same

yes<ac_metadata title="you are a true gift"> </ac_metadata>

hell yeah, a sane BFDI fan.

yes

yes my pure memeful Navid is a super gift

The steven universe wiki is lucky to have you

IF YOU DONT LET YOYLE CAKE WIN then you will turn into metal FOR YOUR REST OF YOUR LIFE!

RLLY wait who is this

a y y  l m a o

wOW THANKS

But we're lucky to have you too scream

"Object shows?" Is...is that really a genre?

<span style="line-height:20px;">*googles for more information*</span>

'''MOTHER OF GOD.'''

If somebody turned into metal they will be inanimate and DIE! 

Oh great,we are spamming pictures and gifs

Ok so many SU fans are spamming some "seek medical help","no",and"it's time to stop"

That's like,spamming a bit 

There are few People that are spamming Yoylecake for more than 5-7 times 

Pitt cola and Pawpsicles aren't spamming but Pawpsicles won't stand a chance

Btw just post the "'''DO NOT COMMENT TO VOTE''' just so the spam might go lower a bit so just say Yoylecake once and then it doesn't coun as spam ok Yoylecake fans?

At least we will get immune to most things 😗

Yoyleberries just turn you into metal UNTIL you die so that means you are still alive when you are metal that also means that you could be immune to lots of things

"wtf is a yoylecake"

Go get your laptop, sit in the motherfucking corner, and watch BFDI for fuck's sake.

Nah.

Go Pitt Soda! Piss off Steven Universe!

CAN EVERYONE JUST STOP FIGHTING?!?!?!

I ESPECIALLY DO NOT WANT TO SEE DEATH THREATS AND INSULTS!!!!!!!!! IT'S STUPID AND I WANT TO END THIS FOR ALL GOODNESS AND DIGNITY!

SO JUST STOP!!!

How to avoid spam: Don't look at the comments.

How to combat spam: Spam "DON'T SPAM" and expect results.

DO NOT COMMENT TO VOTE!

(Also, if you wanna know, I'm voting for Yoylecake. plz no h8)

the together breakfast v pitt soda is causing me pain

I care more about this than the presidential election

God bless America

Dawn of the final day

24 hours remain!

what even is pitt cola

Spamming Yoylecake isn't going to do anything guys. It's worthless.

Can you stop spamming Yolecake and together breakfast

I agree

Same here if Pitt cola wins it won't be fair

A gravity falls drink

BFDI & GF Won!!!!!!!!!!!!

aww po together breakfast lost

Im voting Yoylecake... Because Gravity Falls got to the finals three times in a row!

go yoylecake

OMG GUESS WHO IM VOTING

Jeez Yoylecake DEMOLISHED Pawpsicles :0

We know we want YoyleCake but just dont say it out loud so much please

It's a cake appearing in a show called BFDI. Yes, it's colour scheme is really bad, but that's because it was made form yoyleberries in yoyleland(No, I'm serious, the creator of BFDI made yoylecake, so if you don't believe me, ask him). Yoyleland if a place of purple grass, and the only plants living there are Yoyleberry bushes(which we also mainly purple). No one knows why yoyleland is purple. BFDI AKA Battle For Dream Island was made by YouTube User 'jacknjellify'. Two people own that channel, who also animate and voice act BFDI. They are Michael Huang and Cary Huang. And yes, it does turn you into metal. Specifically, the metal is called yoylemetal. Yoylemetal is impossible to freeze.

Thereselovesyou I wished that this was opened for every country I'm a kiwi and I'm 11 and if I win a trip to New York I'm not going because I not from us and I filled out the form

Also together breakfast is out

Imagine how the Steven Universe fans would react to Together Breakfest losing.... Oh wait you dont have to.

I swear to god if pitt cola loses i will hook up a mega speaker to every large city big screen and across the world 4 words will be heard.

IT'S TIME TO STOP

go yoylecake 

so sad about together breakfast

I voted Yoylecake. AND NOW YOYLECAKE WON WOOOOOOOOO!!!!

yoylecake won cuz of me! wooooooooooo!!!!

Sad that Together Breakfast lost, but at least it will make it to the food truck.

But anyway, PITT COLA MUST WIN!

Sobbing

WITH A DOUBT ，PITT COLA''' A''''''LRE''''''ADY JOINED LAST YEAR'S  RACE!!!!!'''

@Navid I agree.

Well,this finale is just too easy and neutral at the same time so that means avenging all the other ones that we wanted to win is now very possible

They have smile dip that joined which was winner so they already won,time for a new winner

At least Manila city is not that big,not even taking most part of the ncr

Here are some reasons to not vote for Pitt cola:

It's not a food

It had smile dip which already won for them

SU fans this is for you:Because it beat your nominee

It's not good anymore

So you shouldn't vote for this

YOYLECAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

YOYLECAKE IS DA BEST!!!!!!!!!!

Reasons to vote yoylecake:

Its actually food

Bubble

Pitt cola = Coca Cola in a diffrently branded can

Several flavours in yoylecake

*screams yoylecake*

Yoylecake shall TRIUMPH!

the su fans one doesn't even make any sense, because if it beats our nominee, that means it's still good, or even better.

Pitt cola beat you together breakfast fans so just vote for Yoylecake since they didn't beat you

I actually voted for Pitt Cola in the semi finals, so Yoylecake wouldn't face off against Steven Universe in the final.

Yeah that was also my plan

This guy down here vvv

Yoylecake to New York!

PITT COLA IS NOT A FOOD >:(

First of all i love Pawpsicles, but im a BFDI fan.

But when Yoylecake win with a '''HUGE DIFFERENCE''', and Together Breakfast being lost, i want Yoylecake to win for Pawpsicles and T.B.

Secondly, Pitt Cola is not a food but a drink but i don't want to purged Gravity Falls, in fact i am also a fan of it!

In this case i am a fan of gravity falls and steven universe. Am i a fan of Zootopia? I still don't watch Zootpey. So yeah let the greatest food win. :)

I wonder ff Inanimate Insanity's Oatmeal Raisin Cookies joined

i am one of the yoylecake voters, but i REALLY wish that the bscotch pie won because it would taste so good i can feel it in my mouth right now ;-;

ARIGHT WHOS GOING TO BE A WINNER

WILL IT BE YOYLECAKE OR PITTCOLA

Yeah so that's why we are avenging all the great foods that were from the popular fandoms

Vote for Yoylecake since it has the advantage x500 and Pitt cola is not a food lol

The cookies weren't ate since mephone4 hasn't ate a single cookie starting the finale of season 1 of II and the cookies were destroyed in the explosion with mephone5 and bow

8 more days,omg the hype is growing but I will for get about it for a day because my field trip is on Friday :D

IfyoupeoplearereadingthisthenyouknowwhatIamsaying

Yoylecakemustwinpittcolamustlose

Let's take a trip down memory lane:

Yoylecake was up against Black Forest cake of portal in the first round then it won

Yoylecake was up against gobblegum of COD in the second round and it won

Yoylecake was up against rainbow confetti bread of bread winners in the third round and it won

Yoylecake was up against Moo moo milk of Pokemon in the fourth round and that's when people started arguing but it won

Yoylecake was up against Pawpsicles in the Semifinals and that is when Pawpsicles started spamming but it won

Pitt cola was up against sugar prop of Adventure time in the first round but it won

Pitt cola was up against fruit pie of Avatar in the second round but it won

Pitt cola was up against Chinese food in the shape of a swan of archer in the third round but it won

Pitt cola was up against Ton tongue Toffee in the fourth round but it won 

Pitt cola was up against Together breakfast of Steven Universe in the Semifinals and that round is when we most thought that Pitt cola finally lost but it still won

And now Yoylecake is up against Pitt cola

Porp*

I agree.

I vote..........

I vote.......

Yoylecake is in the finals but with Pitt cola

i wonder what michael and cary do if yoylecake wins

YOYLECAKEFTW

😄

Isn't Battle for Dream Island just another one of those inanimate object animation series using that one template?

no,it was actually the FIRST one.

IT created the template.

also the later episode is amazing.

GO YOYLECAKE![[File:Yoylecake.gif|thumb|Bubble: VOITE YOIYLECOIK SIO OIT COIN WOIN FOIR MOIE!]]

VOTE FOR PITT COLA

IN CIPHER'S GAME HE NEEDS PITT COLA

Pitt cola is awesome

Bubble Bass: I want a double triple bossy deluxe, on a raft, animal style, extra shingles, with a shimmy and a squirm, burn it, make it cry, and let it swim.

Squidward: We serve food here sir.

-Pickles, Season 1

Gravity falls rules

Pitt Cola is soda, it does nothing. It's just soda.

Yoylecake is said to be delicious, and it's made from Yoyleberries in Yoyleland. Yoylecake turns you into metal whenever you eat it.

See the difference?

In Cipher's game, he needs a pwan, a pawn to defeat Yoylecake using Pitt Cola once and for all

sTAHP not being a meme bOI

NO! HE NEEDS YOYLECAKE!

NO

HE NEEDS PITT COLA!!!!

Yoylecake FTL

Pitt Cola

And your not nice. >:(

If you are mean to the people how vote for yoylecake then fuck off

I can't belive there are people being mean to people who are voting for yoylecake like Trigger Happy the Gremlin

Well, I'm surprised. The first comment I saw wasn't yoylecake spam. I am generally afraid of the Gravity Falls fandom now

If you are being mean to the people who vote for yoylecake then please stop!

Bubble needs to be popped.

 #PURGEBFDI

You must die Trigger Happy the Gremlin

Yoylecake is an artificially flavored cake lined with turd blossoms.

Pitt Cola is a peach soda which, apparently, everybody in the town of Gravity Falls likes.

Decide on what to vote for, trust your instincts (unless your instincts suck).

Actually, Yoylecake is a cake that is made out of Yoyleberries, along with other ingredients, making for endless different flavors of a cake.

All Pittcola is is a peach flavored soda that has a pit in it, from my knowledge.

The characters in BFDI like Yoylecake, and I'm pretty sure no "turd blossoms" are lined in Yoylecake. I can only assume that you're a Gravity Falls fan, and don't know any better.

PITT COLA

Reasons why you should vote for Pitt Cola

Because Cipher "drank it like a human person"

Pitt Cola is loved by the townsfolk of gravity falls and is almost in every episode

Vote for pitt cola

Yoylecake vs. Diabetes Juice.

Oh god. Now everyone is spamming Pitt Cola. 

The next person that talks about Pitt Cola in the comments, I'll report to the admin as spam lol.

I am going againest Pitt Cola. Trust your instinct and join me!

Yoylecake makes you invincible. (But it comes in a price by turning you metal.)

Pitt Cola gives you diabetes. (By drinking one can) 

Which is better: Invincibility or Diabetes?

[[File:OK_I_AM_NOT_A_SAVAGE_ALLRIGHT?_.png|thumb]]

Hmmm... I'd say... Neither.

They both sound pretty bad.

Yoylecake needs too win

...you're complaining about PITT COLA being spammed? Have you ever seen the hundreds of yoylecake spammers?

i really hope pitt cola gets it tbh... i was rooting for together breakfast or toriel's butterscotch-cinnamon pie but pitt cola is the next best thing :D

Also, all the characters have such personality! And anyone who likes Inanimate Insanity better is stupid, because without BFDI, II wouldn't exist!!!

Both of the final 2 foods come from shows that have had very long hiatuses.

BFDI's wait for BFDIA 6,

and 

Gravity Falls' wait for Season 2

gravity falls is gay

<p style="font-weight:normal;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">I voted Yoylecake</p>

<p style="font-weight:normal;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">

<p style="font-weight:normal;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">1v1 me on club penguin if ur mad at me because i have a different opinion than you</p>

we must not let evil pitt cola win

It is quite light-hearted and carefree.

I can tell your salty that your favorite food lost

You know, past the first vote, all the votes look heavily one-sided. I mean that "Yoylecake" thing has won all its votes by 85-90%. And I don't even know what the thing is.

looks like someone is salty

We're leaving together<br />But still it's farewell<br />And maybe we'll come back<br />To Earth, who can tell?I guess there is no one to blame<br />We're leaving ground (leaving ground)<br />Will things ever be the same again?It's the final countdown<br />The final countdown Welp it's the end, the SU fans are salty, the BFDI fans and GF fans are spamming, and Zootopia fans are nowhere to be found.Good luck everyone

yeah they are everywhere

You're so mean

People are being mean to us and everyone who voted for yoylecake just because we voted for yoylecake

<span style="font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:22px;">People are being mean to us and everyone who voted for yoylecake just because we voted for yoylecake</span>

Will you be mean to people who voted for yoylecake like the others

YEAH

Stop being mean to people who voted for yoylecake like me

How is Gab Quilario not being nice?

Imagine if Steven Universe won. Oh wait Steven Universe got eliminated by a blowout!

OMG BFDIA 6 is coming out just a day after this ends

+10000 hype

Okay yes BFDI fans should unite but this is too far

HE NEEDS PITT YOYLECAKE

Maybe after all of this

We should all get even

And spill some Pitt Cola on the Yoylecake

Flip a coin.

Sorry Blocky was popped instead

81%???

We just had a whole season in a month GF ended half a year ago! I don't even remember anyone mention it in two weeks! Pitt cola is not even something you would want to drink. Can anyone explain this to me? 

<span style="line-height:20px;font-size:13px;">lethaldoseofsalt</span>

Yoyle cake

lol the ones on the bottom are out

Why not vote for yoylecake?

i dont think you would want to eat yoylecake either, because you'd turn into metal

Yoylecake won't turn you into metal irl. 

Yoy! Yoylecake is in the finale!

Also, please don't spam.

Its from BFDI, an object show

This spam is getting annoying

Also yoylecaik

Turning into metal would be awesome because you would be like colossus and you would be unfreezing because it's yoyle metal plus the effects are temporary.

The effects are temporary.

Nah that's too little.

"I'm a kiwi" Do you know what kiwis are?

Its A Cake versus a Soda, WHO WILL WIN?

Let's just say Pitt Cola wins regardless of the votes being more to yoylecake.

Honestly I think that if Anonymous accounts couldn't vote Yoylecake would've lost rounds ago lol

Plus, having a YT channel with thousands of subscribers telling them to vote is really unfair. Alex didn't make a video for us to vote Pitt Cola. Rebecca, or any other Crewniverse member, made a video telling us to vote Together Breakfast. So the only people of the fandom who actually knows about this are some few users from the shows' wiki. This is, what, 300 users? I guess around that. It's clear who has the advantage here.

Having online fans is 100% what this contest is about

It is literally the only source of votes

Huh. I'm genuinely shocked that SU lost, especially by ''that'' much. Oh well, the weird breakfast will still be made regardless :b.

Gravity Falls has a BIG fandom, and pretty much all of them vote on this.

kill pitt cola

Yeah, I kinda feel the same way, but if Alex Hirsh had wanted to make a video about this for some reason, we would probably win. (without spam too probably.) But is not a big deal and he didn't so, whatevs.

never

yeah it really is. GF Fans don't rally spam or even comment at all. I guess they're more mature.

YOYLE CAKE

How come Pitt Cola all of a sudden gives you diabetes now?!?! It NEVER said that in the show. It's just a soda guys. (No one said this about Nuka Cola last year...)

May the best fantasy food wins!!

Ay it's me from drooodle!<ac_metadata title="It&#039;s me, Golden Gaming!"> </ac_metadata>

Guys, stop spamming please. I thought the Gravity Falls fandom was more mature.

Just go with your gut

Aimed at lightningsoos78: you arent really that mature for saying that, you know. You are calling someone else immature to make yourself seem mature but its backfiring

Looks like Together Breakfast was beaten by Pitt Cola, Yoylecake has beaten Pawpsicles

I expect alot of SU fans to be mad.

YOY-le cake

Really wtf to all the people saying gf should win ITS JUST SODA!!!! I'm voting yoylecake. I still like gravity falls but sorry yoylecake is better

I'm honestly suprprise that Pitt cola mad it to the finals. I thought TB would win

YOYLECAKE YOYLECAKE YOYLECAKE

Yeah and Gravity Falls made it to the finals three years in a row!

Well i am a BFDI fan and vote YoyleCake but look just keep it to yourself, you can show it at the beginning but just stop, this is not the beginning anymore, We know YoyleCake is overpowered but just stop.

What im saying is we now YoyleCake is overpowered but just stop spam.

Stop spamming wikia contriber

I vote Yoylecake because Pitt Cola is not a food.

Who else agrees that this guy needs to stop spamming?

Stop spamming

I do

Bubble my buddy your cake will be served soon! 😜😝🙌🙋🙆😹😸🔜😀😁😂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎈🎆🎇🎉🎊🎁🎀🎍🎋🐱

Where did the voting page go???

Aww i wanted Gravity Falls to lose, i voted SU every round cause its opponent was worse :l

Oy, Anon. Could ya stop spamming for Pitt Cola?

''*sigh*''

I... sorta appreciate your effort, though.

Seriously, what is Yoylecake? It just looks like a multi-coloured drum with small, suggestive-looking spikes attached to it.

Who?

Aww too bad for you SU fangirl :(

omg 9 or 8 more days :)

yoyle cake

is wining

if your being dicks to people with a diffrent opinion then you then fuck off gravity falls dipshits

I wonder how they'll make the Yoylecake. Will it really turn people into metal? lol, GO YOYLECAKE!

GO YOYLECAKE!

Real life version of Yoylecake?

Would you rather drink peach soda, or eat yoyleberry cake? A very unusual flavoured soda, or a cake that can turn you into 'yoylemetal'(which apparently, is unfreezable)?

What is your proof that Pitt Cola can give you diabetes?

''Turd Blossoms''? Where the heck did you get that from? Artificially flavoured? Do you have any proof? Please, check your facts, before making a statement.

Just make a cake made of peach and yoyleberries.

You can't suck Yoylecake. Only Pitt Cola.

You can't tell him what to do! He has rights! You don't have any control over his life! He is stating his opinion, and just because you don't like it, you want them to die? What is wrong with you?!

Yoylecola

Pitt Cake

He's just stating his opinion, there's know need to make a man-hunt.

He's just stating his opinion, there's no need to pop a bubble.

You can't force people to stop.

@AquaticPanic 'Kiwi' is a colloquialism in New Zealand meaning New Zealander. It's not the bird.

No it's not. If you disagree, do you have any proof?

My mum use to make these for us - they are delicious!!

Hi, I'm an admin for the {{SITENAME}} community. Welcome and thank you for your edit to [[:Burmese Potato Cutlets]]!

Yes bill Cipher shall be brought into this.

Hi, I'm an admin for the {{SITENAME}} community. Welcome and thank you for your edit to [[:Fijian Honey Cake]]!

SU fans are ALWAYS mad. They made a 13 year old girl try to commit suicide, just because the kid drew a character's weigh wrong. Good going, SU fans.

Nope. I watched the entire series, and there wasn't any gay couples.

"YOYLE CAKE!"- Bubble 2011

You know, you shouldn't tell people to kill themselves just because they like another cartoon better than Gravity Falls.<ac_metadata title="Why are you such a big cyber bully?"> </ac_metadata>

YOYLECAKE IN UR MOUTH

*and then you turned into metal.*

How would Tennis Ball win? Hes not even a food???

OMG YOYLECAKE IS IN THE FINALE!!!!

The reason why Together Breakfest lost was that the Yoylecake voters voted for Pitt Cola

What do you choose? A delicious cake or disgusting soda

By TB, he means Together Breakfast.

I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY FOR BFDI AND BFDIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At least us bfdi fans will get bfdi if we lose or win

As in bfdi is back even Yoylecake loses

They will probably put too much iron (the mineral of health) and literally make people turn into metal

Just watch bfdi a and bfdia in YouTube

Want gravity falls to lose?

Vote Yoylecake!

What is the main reason why you don't want to vote for Yoylecake?

Not asking you Yoylecake voters

i like invicibility but until you pee...

lol if your from the Midwest, say Pop not soda

Guys, I know everyone will get mad at me when I say this, but I voted for Yoylecake. I just want to apologize on the Yoylecake voters' behalf. The people who are spamming the word "YOYLECAKE!!!" are not true BFDI fans because the creator of BFDI has publicly stated on YouTube not to spam. I am so, so sorry about these people that are making the BFDI community look like a bunch of little kids.

(And yes, I love Gravity Falls, but I like cake more than soda.)

Spam + I lOve gravity falls

Alright voters, the odds are against us, but like my old man Peppy used to say, never give up! Trust your instincts! Now vote! Vote all you can! Vote until it's all over! Show them the true power of your votes!

I choose the "disgusting" soda.

at the end, it's Pitt cola vs. yoylecake,

whoever wins, I'll take.

it's a GG for us,

us SU fans' loss,

but I'm fine with it,

I don't care who wins or lose it

but I must say

do not spam the comment section as a play

(I suck at rhyming, don't I?)

I don't like cake and love gf so it is a win win in my situation.

PITT COLA! I love pitt cola but i always forget aout the pitt. 

Actually this poem's pretty good! But I'm also a GF fan, I was voting for SU but it lost so now I'm gonna vote for GF

Peach Pitt soda...under A delicious cake

You don't even think about the food

I voted for together breakfast so I could stop GF

Congrats on rightfully winning, Pitt cola! It's extremely unfair that the creator of bfdi urged people to vote.

!!!PLEASE READ THIS BERFORE YOU START TYPING ANOTHER SPAM MESSAGE!!

Just stop all of the Yoylecake and Pitt Cola spam, guys!!

There are LOTS of mean spam voting Pitt Cola that was never there in the other rounds!

I think most of it is being caused by other fandoms that lost to Yoylecake in other rounds, and now that its the final round the only other thing to vote for is Pitt Cola so people who don't want to vote for Yoylecake vote for Pitt Cola, and start spamming the comments and being mean!

PLEASE STOP THIS!!!!!!! It's making the Gravity Falls fandom look really bad and mean!! There were almost no Pitt Cola comments in all of the other rounds and if there was it wasn't mean spam! Almost no true Gravity Falls fan would do this. But now since thats the only other thing, other fandoms are being SUPER mean to the BFDI fandom. People who haven't watched Gravity Falls probably wont want to now because of what people are acting like here.

Just please stop. If you don't want to vote for Yoylecake then just don't, but please do not start spamming in the comments. This is supposed to be a fun competition. Thanks.

(Also whoever is doing all of the "Seek Medical Help" pictures, please stop. it's really annoying.)

Guys, vote Pitt cola. Soda has to be made in a factory and can never be bought for free. You can make your own soda at home with soda stream. But it still costs money to make it. First you need to buy the device to carbonate the water, then the syrup to flavor it.

Yoylecake, is made from something that isn't even a thing. Yoyleberries. A lot of its fandom is 7 year olds who can't even see the contrast between dream worlds/cringe worthy cartoons and reality, that you have to tell them the truth before they grow into a world of lies and try to search for those berries until they turn to dust after death. Besides, you can make a cake at home for free and design it how you want. You'll probably have to wait an hour or two for the cake to be made, whereas you don't have  to wait for soda. You can take it, buy it, then crack open the can. Enjoy.

Well that is kind of a negative way to put it.

Guys, Pitt cola and Yoylecake are already going to be at comic con. We don't need to agrue over it and constantly attack other fandoms. That just makes all of us seem like dicks.

You're just saying that to make me look like a dick because you're obviously a BFDI fan. How old are you?

Agreed, I like both of the fandoms but seeing each one getting hate comments really triggers me. Everyone should read your post and learn something.

I hate its taste. I went during April vacation and it tasted nasty.

.........

Plz dont be mean

That mean (lol)

I know they "made" people vote for yoyle cake but i voted cuz i wanted to do yoyle cake.

(Im gonna get a lot of hate for this)but i like cake better than soad.

Just think of it is as cake vs soad.

I vote cake.

This seems biased. 

You need money to make both soda and cake. I mean, soda might be more expensive to make, but you still need a lot of ingredients for cake. 

Im pretty sure that there's a lot of younger BFDI fans, but most of them won't think there's actually a cake that'll turn people into metal or think that Yoyleberries exist.

Plus, the cake will probably taste like normal berries or something. 

Pick Yoylecake and my username in roblox is zinorules

yoylecake BFDI sitting on a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G

VOTE FOR YOYLECAKE!!!!

YAS

That picture is spam.

vote yoylecake or ill cry, and i cry acid

YOYLECAKE 4 LIFE

I would, but I don't have a vote button because budget cuts.

sorry but im immune to acid 

Battle of *fictional* foods.

Yes, I agree. It's pointless, stupid, and especially immature. Plus, it makes our fandoms look bad.

I'm a SU fan, but I'm not angry. (I'm also a BFDI[A] fan.) Fpr the comment above mine, that's just wrong. Imagine if you got a SU's character's hair wrong and people '''''FORCE YOU TO COMMIT SUICIDE'''''.  Seriously.

*For

Used to be Ice Cube, but now it's Book. But I still like Icy though! 

Yup. This is it.

Agreed.

I didn't mean to make you look like a dick, I just wanted to say that the comment you said was rather mean. And why are you asking for my age? That's really disturbing.

...

No thank you.

Yoylecake.

lolo chicas cupcake never went further

seek medical happiness

COME ON YOYLECAKE

ok sorry but I cant find the vote box due to me reseting LOTS OF TIMES

<span style="font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:22px;">Alright voters, the odds are against us, but like my old man Peppy used to say, never give up! Trust your instincts! Now vote! Vote all you can! Vote until it's all over! Show them the true power of your votes!</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Also, to you "seek medical help" guys, SEEK MEDICAL HELP! I'm sure there's a doctor close to you!</span>

GO YOYLECAKE!!!!!!

BFDIA 6 IS COMING!!!!!!!!

Comments are complete chaos now. Everywhere is spammed with yoylecake, even though I vote for it, there is lots of seek medical help pictures in the comments, lots of hate, and I think this is getting ridiculous<ac_metadata title="Comments"> </ac_metadata>

Go yoylecake

''YOUYALCAKE''

Bummer. Steven Universe lost. By a lot. A little surprised. Oh well. Pitt Cola gets my vote. I would love to get into battle for dream island but these spammers are ruining it for me.

Dude why let a bad fanbase ruin something for you. its stupid.

I agree!

I vote for one more the yoylecake

I vote yoylecake in bfdi because I saw the video all guys vote yoylecake

I would put a "ogm vote for yaylecooke" here, but jacknjellify told me not to.

BTW, Before stepping into here, you'll be faced with the following:

Triggered Fanboys/Fangirls, Arguments, Spam Comments (vate yaylecook!) People who use the picture "seek medical attention", basically, you get the point.

dont tell me i didnt warn u silly n0b

Even if you WANT pitt cola to win, you've basically gave some new comers what the gravity falls community is like.

Stop being a fucking dick, you don't need to call out BFDI just because you want pitt cola to win.

Do something like "Guys, vote pitt cola!" or "Go pitt cola!" Instead of that whole fucking text.

Plus, I've seen the BFDI community, ALL of them know that yoyleberries aren't real because they use common sense.

Haven't you also seen how much bfdi is dominating? They have a HUGE chance of winning.  So take Micheal Jordan's advice:[[File:Stopit.jpg|thumb]]

Congratulations sir, you've earned the medal of "I actually have a brain and use common sense" medal.

You're one of the only intelligent people in this forum, who didn't destroy my brain cells. Thanks mate.

Um..I never knew telling people to vote was unfair.                                                                                                          what.

um ok

We aren't a bad fanbase otherwise we wouldn't have made it this far.

Also, Pitt Cola won? I didn't see that coming

I voted, and so should everyone else who see BFDIA6 trailer

I'm glad that both Spongebob and Total Drama were avenged

I WAN'T IOYUKAIKE!

YOYLECAKE!!!!!!!

You clearly didn't listen to what they said.

Why do you still spam?

It's a cute feel good web series. Don't want any of the other Object Show ripoffs though. Pretty much all of them suck in some sort of way.

e d g y 

i saw me in the bfdia 6 deleted scenes but that was before i knew not to comment yoylecake

(With a handful of exceptions)

GOD  Pudding I am a fan of both

Ps I got mad and brought it up to my sisters and they were so mad at me for me only voting for  Yoylecake

Yoylecake! I Vote Yoylecake.

Just because something is fantasy doesn't mean that it's bad.

It's extremely unfair that a creator cared?

Since when was telling people to vote for something unfair?

"hey underage please leave the internet and"

[[File:Stopnow.jpg|thumb|288px]]listen to jack black m8 ->

Yoylecake is a fantasy cake made from the exotic yoyleberries (which obviously don't exist in real life). Bubble, a character from BFDI (the show that came up with yoylecake) is the reason people know about it, as in the later episodes she shouts "YOYLECAKE!" a lot.

That's yoylecake, and some other shit..

DON't spam yoylecake

Yoylecake Is My new flashback because bubble got popped so mnay damn times

Stop complaining about Yoylecake winning guys, Yoylecake is obviously liked by more users, deal with it.

Do not comment vote,instead click the icon and press the vote button to vote vote vote

While Gravity Falls is definitely a great show, I think Yoylecake would be a better tasting for the people who go to the Comic-Con.

I've had enough of the Yolecake spam its getting old guys cut it out this Yolecake spam is just as bad if the warriors miss the playoffs for the 5th year in a row also I just hope that this is my last comment on here also if you're are kiwi GO THE WARRIORS LET'S HOPE THAT THE WARRIORS BEAT THE WEST TIGERS ON SUNDAY 4 PM NEW ZEALAND TIME

Arrged

dont spam the comments fam

YES YOYLE CAKE WON

YOYLE CAKE WONNNNNNNNNNNNN

YEASHHHHHHHH

This entire thing basically became a joke. Thanks, Yoylecake.

^

Exactly. Since yoylecake obviously gonna to be the winner, i dont really get why these 11 years old are still spamming. Probably have nothing better to do or just pure retarded lmao.

And how exactly, will you do that?

So you are saying that just because it's made of something that doesn't exist, you can't make it out of something else that's similar? Yes, Pitt Cola is easier to make and consume, but would you rather drink peach soda or berry cake? Who cares if it takes a while to bake cake? The cooks are probably going to bake it beforehand.

Well, the creator of Gravity Falls could add in the credits of one of GF's episodes to vote for Pitt Cola.

Pitt as in the Pit of A Peach.

Exactly. One cake has more food that one soda.

Stop Plagiarising other people's work. It was obviously not your 'Seek Medical Help' meme. Please ask permission before using someone else's meme.

And how, exactly, are you going to make that happen? Please explain. You can't tell the creator of BFDI to tear his object show down without good reason.

I want Yoylecake so bad.

If anyone wins Yoylecake, tell me the recipe and tell Feast of Fiction the recipe too!

I'd love to see how to create BFDIs Best cake ever!

I voted Yoylecake, but im dying still 

clod

In previous years, Alex has tweeted about this. I'm not certain if any of the crewniverse has tweeted about this.

Guys, if BFDI loses, at least BFDI will end its 3 year hiatus the day after it loses.

If Gravity Falls loses, it will be sad, because Gravity Falls is gone, and there's a chance that it won't be in next year's battle.

I voted Yoylecake, but I will be happy if either wins. Good luck to both, because I know for a fact that both are very amazing shows

He said dont spam

I dunno but the creators of BFDI told us not to spam

Yoyle will probably win, but I hope Gravity Falls does too.

Because spammers, Together Breakfast lost. Sad, but Pitt cola for the win!

If Human Soda™ will win, I'll be very happy

Did BFDI/BFDIA win?

welcome to the sea of salty spam 

Hater? What? This is hating for you?

Shut up.

Shut the hell up, you are not funny.

[[File:Seek_medical_help.jpg|right]]

omg i cant believe people vote for pitt cola because gravity falls is stupid

You do know that yoyle cake won every match with over a 70% of zhe votes right?

@ [http://recipes.wikia.com/wiki/User:Razpup09 Razpup09] Because his channel has THOUSANDS of subscribbers, while the other fandoms only know about this via wiki, and not even everyone on the wiki cares. That's clearly unfair.

Ahh i see now you are the spammers aren't ya?

Cancer alert

You got to be kidding....

Careful, you might cut yourself on that edge.

I want YOYALCAKE NOT A GAY ASS SODA!!!!

lawl.

Pitt Cola could taste disgusting, but mmmmmmmm yoylecake!

Just because yoylecake is a fan favourite? Seriously we have to expect the expected sometimes.

They came back as 172.56.38.205. You need to stop them!

I vote Yoylecake

I THINK I MADE YOYLECAKE WIN

YOYLECAKE IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!

Bubble: YOYLECAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!

So.. You said pitt cola is stupid and then you said yoylecake was stupid. Do you not have a side for this? Or do you give nothing? I'm confused.

Uh,you keep saying the word "Yoylecake",thus buring the word into the voters mind.

The only logical person here

Lq,I agree.

Unknown Dude:SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP

OH JEEZ

Then again any spammer kinda deserves it

And I deserve it for being a cringy person

No spam as <span style="font-weight:normal;">Vote </span>Yoylecake in the comments

This has been tried before,and since we're at the end,welcome to the Spam Spitoon.

Please please stop

Yep. I wanted that to qualify. And above, STYU

(Shut The Yoylecake Up)

(I DON'T HATE ON YOYLECAKE)

Vlad,YOUR REVEALING PERSONAL INFO. Did your mum tell you not to reveal your personal info?

But I would like the recipe,though.

Kill yourself, nobody cares that you are a hater BFDI. If you want to play the hater, kill yourself

No spam here, as are prohibited spam comments asking to vote

A fan of BFDI that loves Gravity Falls may have no choice but agrees to vote for the 2010 object animation show. Yoylekek VS Pitt Cola. THE FINALS HAS BEGUN.

And you need to stop being so butthurt.

Some of you GF and BFDI fans will might spam their food/drinks in the comments for them to win, but stop spamming it, don't you know what 'jacknjellify' said to not tell people voting the food they want you to vote? Vote the food/drink you want everyday for a chance to win

The comments:Welcome to the Spam Spitoon,which do you vote for?

Pawpsicles are gone, we are free from them now but we will go, to the moment that we see, a slice of Yoylecake, a step closer to the win after every single round! (#DolanadeforBOFF2017)

jacknjellify doesn't want you to talk about voting Yoylecake in the comments but just vote away

WE GET IT OK!

laster

What the heck even is yolecake

Get an education?? Why dont you get an education? Man, all these capital letters and punctuation mistakes... I even like Gravity Falls and still like BFDI. Also if you can prove to me your 2 gear old cousin can draw, animate, talk normally, design original characters, and do this all very often then I will respect this opinion.

OMG!! Yoylecake

Actually, metal is a frozen liquid. Technically it's not unfreeze able, it's just already frozen.

Wtf

Oh god......... 

{{w:Matheus_Leonardo}}

Yoylecake or Pitt Cola? I love both......

''I'm voting Yoylecake, Please don't kill me......''

'''Yeh.. :P'''

Yoylecake! #BFDIA6!

seems legit

US YOYLEGODS

Both are good fandoms, hard to tell who wins.

If yoylecake wins, thank me.

A lot of people, actually

WHOS READY FOR  CAKE AT STAKE!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!1!11!!!!!!! 

Good Luck BFDI and GF I like them both

I just noticed that Pitt Cola was in the 2013 Battle of the fantasy foods! :P

No

YOYLECAKE!!!!!!!!! SCREW PITT COLA

Good luck to BFDI and Gravity Falls. I like both of them but i like yoylecake more.

go yoylcake :)

I'm still confused on why what the ability of the food matters. It will not translate to real life.

WHAT?! PITT COLA IS BEAT TOGETHER BREAKFAST?![[File:No.png|thumb|330px|No. NO. NOOOOO!!!]]

Well, I mean it is just waffles, whipcream, popcorn and a strawberry.Not exactly a fantasy food per se 

Why cant everyone not spam like GF wasnt really spamming before this and BFDI was asked to not spam by its creators seriously guys

"PITT COLA IS BEAT" Uh... I think you mean "Has beaten"

These are the average percantges for the final two added from the five rounds.

Yoylecake         83.3%

Pit Cola            75.1%

So on average peformance Yoylecake is winning.

However... This is the final round, anything can happen in this round, Good luck everyone!

Yoylecake!!!1!!

Lol it's not "supposed" to win. Only the voters can try to make it win. Also, please pay attention in literacy class.

The spam of Yoylecake and Pitt Cola is getting out of control! There are people spamming both sides, death threats, now screamer links. Exc

I love BFDI and Gravity falls. But if people are going to to spam. I don't feel like wanting to vote for either of them. ;-;

Also Therese, Thank you for hosting Battle of the fantasy foods 2016! Cant wait for next year!

Hi, I'm an admin for the {{SITENAME}} community. Welcome and thank you for your edit to [[:Tongan Cuisine]]!

No it's not.

Stop

83.3% and 75.1% at the same time don't work out.

Well yoylecake is gonna be crap flavored.

They honestly should.

Can we all just be quiet and vote normally pls. >.>

Wow Pitt Coloa actually survived Together breakfast and thrashed them good job Gravity falls

Come back again next year with the cookie cat-thing then.

Yoylecake? Crap flavored? Are you insane? They won't sell out cake made of shit in New York, that would be very disgusting and disappointing.

PITT COLA!

Hammer time!

All these persople need to vote for Ypyelcake

I get it. YOLOCake as in You Only Live Once Cake. Meaning the cake will kill you if consumed.

I like the face you made. Yay.

Just because there is spam, you don't like Yoylecake? That's like saying if so many people are urging others to buy something, you'd rather not buy it. @GreenQueen1287

They even won last year

Some people are voting

People that read the comment up there are like:

😠😠😠😠😠😠🔪🔪🔪🔪😡😡😡⚔⚔⚔⚔👿😾😾🌵🌵🌵

At least he didn't tell where or how he looks like

Voting Pitt Cola because of Yoylecake spammers

The people who said Gravity Falls and BFDI are stupid are two different people.

That was so much yoylecake please stop spamming right now. Come o-

u've gotta be kidding me.

Im a BFDI fan :P

PITT COLA IS IN 2013 AND ITS NOT A FOOD ITS A DRINK

Yep,we don't want a flame war.

I think after this is over,there's going to be a gigantic flame war between the OSC and the Gravity Falls Community.

I have no idea if i should vote for Pitt Cola and Yoylecake.

*or

Too bad, there are just way too many mentally questionable people in this comment section. Calling them kids are an insult to all the kids too.

<span style="font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:22px;">YOYLECAKE YOYLECKE YOYLECAKE </span>

<span style="font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;line-height:22px;">YOYLRCAKEYOYLECAKEYOTLECAKEYOYLECAKE</span>

I didn't realize Cary was so popular...

Are you kidding me? How did stupid stevens "together breakfast" beat toriels Bscotch Pie? Kids these days watching so many garbage shows.

Buy a chair!

Yoylecake percent: 91.4% Pitt Cola precent: 81.0%

idk I like both BFDI and Gravity falls ill do BFDI

those percents arn't possible.

do what you want.

Look, Nuka Cola won last time and its a drink.

Yes please.

It's not the gravity falls cominity thats doing the Pitt Cola spam, its mad people that lost to Yoylecake.

I know. The Gravity Falls comunity isn't really the one doing the spam. Its mad people who lost to yoylecake, or just rally don't like BFDI. Theyre voting pitt cola now because theres nothing else to vote.

Anything is possible in Voting

smh i dont like wika but........................ idk

yeah

peeps are gonna gett mad but WHY DIDINT UNDERTALE GET IN THE TOP 2? >:(

I loooove yoylecake!

You got to vote Pitt Cola. Please.

Can you please stop spamming the comments with "VOTE YOYLECAKE", or "VOTE PIT COLA BFDI SUCKS", or "Yoylecake"?

Good. Thank you.

Yoylecake         83.3%

Pit Cola          75.1%

So Yoylecake has a higher average percentage.

While Pitt Cola is the efficiency champion!

suck my balls]

The rules for the Nom-inations state that nom-inations can be either food or drink. As long as it

a.)only exists in that show/game/whatever

b.)hasn't won before.

#Dolanade2017

I know.but somebody's gonna throw the stone and a huge punchup and everyone will be at each other's throats.

But the comments are fun to read to see everyone at each others throats.

Skiddley,I agree. Even though they have had the highest percentage through the contest, at this stage,anything could happen.

Also,it's not your job to be the grammar police,but I agree,pay attention in literacy call random dude who did the main post.

They're both as bad as each other. BFDI is spamming and GF is spamming.

Dude above me,the rule is that winners of pervious years canot come back.

Dolanade for 2017!

...cause a pirate is free

'''*ahem* '''Jacknjellify doesn't want spams like this comment m8

Why is everyone voting for Yoylecake?  And that's not a criticism, it's an actual question.

Because BFDI's creator said to vote for Yoylecake on a Youtube video.

 I don't even know what is battle for dream island but I really like GF so I vote for Pitt Cola GF is the best never mind if it's over

Pitt Cola is peach flavored '''NOT''' fanta flavored

so why yoylecake is in the finale

Yoylecake is a food from BFDI, and the creator made a video saying that people should vote for Yoylecake. 

(to the tune of "We Didn't Start the Fire")

We didn't start the food fight

It was all just random

Foods from every fandom

All our spams were sinning

For we wanted winning

(You can help finish the song by adding other foods that entered the fictional food tournaments!)

Lets be good sports about this. Both shows are good.

I'm pretty sure the Huang twins weren't trying to cause any foul play. You're just a salty Gravity Falls fan trying to make your opponent look bad.

Okay first of all, telling your fans to vote isn't "corrupt." Being corrupt is, like, if they were given money from neo nazis to put hitler in a good light in their next video.

Second, the GF wiki is promoting this poll as well, so really, it's balanced. The only difference is that Disney couldn't give a damn about wikia. 

If you feel like you've been tricked into doing dirty work by voting for something you like, maybe you should drop out of school and steal food to survive. Then you'd only be serving yourself, and never do anything that might - god forbid - accidentally help someone.

Berry cake vs. Illuminati Cola!

('''''YOYLECAKE MUST WIN!''''') 

I'm voting Yoylecake but i wont spam it because i'm not crazy....

Let's go yoylecake

Let me guess, you only watched ep 1 of the first season...

It's bad, i know but trust me. Watch season 2....

VOTE YOYLECAKE CLICKING IN IT

NOT IN THE COMMENTS 

i want yoylecake

BFDI Is Won Of My Favs

Do not spam. Okay

Hmm, what should I vote..

Yoylecake? Or Pitt Cola?

I have no idea.

//runs away

You could have done this in the BFDI comment section.

If I vote yoylecake can i get some :D

There's actually much less yoylecake spam now.

Yoylecake Fans: In your perspective, you see Yoylecake "won", but its not official yet.

Also, please stop spamming "YOYLECAKE". 

Yes,  if go to the comic con in New York City. 

thankyou

Hi, I'm an admin for the {{SITENAME}} community. Welcome and thank you for your edit to [[:Apple and Hazelnut Crunch]]!

Also, some people, like myself, voted for it when they first found out about it (before BFDI's creator made the video), and it made it past round 1

It's tough deciding

PITTTTTTT COLA PITTTTTTT COLA PIRTTTTTT COLA  

Guys if yoyle cake wins or pit cola wins I,m happy :)

I got it wrong it's Pitt cola

I am not exactly sure, but I guess the person who first started calling stuff "cancer" is the YouTube legend, TVFilthyFrank.

Dude With the Spam Shut Up

Make yoylecake (or Pitt Cola) cancerous again.

yoylecakes

FUCK YOU

AND YOU CREATER OF COMMET DIEEE

I HAVE WARNED YOU NO SPAMMING

NO SPAMMING ADMIN PLEASE DELETE THESE SPAMS

PLEASE STOP YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

No! STOP SPAMMING

Did you know science has proven that you can support a fandom AND not spam it in a million times? - Gasp -

PLEASE STOP SPAMMING OK IF YOU DO IT ONEMORE TIME...

For some reason people think that the more they type their food's name in the more votes it'll get.

How did Yoylecake make it so far? I mean, I'm hyped, and it'll hopefully bring more attention to the object show community, but.... wow.

According to my google trends research yoylecake is gonna win the semi finals!

Thats good!

THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED A "VOTE" BUTTON. PRESS THE MATCHUP AND CLICK YOUR SELECTION.

true true

Most likely yoyleccake

Totally agree with ya mate, but some people are just mentally retarded.

agree lmao

you dont have one.

^^BFDI fanboy butthurt much 0.o?

If Gravity Falls loses: At least we won in the past

If Yoylecake loses: At least BFDIA 6 is coming

Great mindset! 

the more you know

BFDI!!!!!!!!!!!! Yoyle Cake

I voted yoylecake, I really want it to win.

Because of all these PITT COLA spammers, it won't have a CHANCE against the bfdi fans... Gravity falls is ''DOOMED.''

There's literally, only a couple Pitt Cola spammers. 

Kill yourself

For real people, Yoyel Cake will literally just be a cake. with food coloring, thats it. I think your better off with the orange is the new black swirl

O love it

WHO SAYS? Maybe if it isn't made from yoyleberry then any kind of berry is still good!

Yoyle cake beated pokemon so....

Yoyleberry doesn't even exist.

They could just make it out of blueberry or boysenberry instead.

I a predicting yoyle cake because it beat pokemon with 80 or 90% and pokemon is a biger show than gravity falls, and it is the same story for zootopia, so yah, yoyle cake will probably win

Yoylecake IS THE GREATEST BFDI CAKE IN THE WHOLE GREATEST WORLD!!!!!!!!

For real people, Pett Cola (notice how we both spelled it wrong) will literally just be a soda. with a pit, thats it. I think your better of with coca cola

Just here to vote for Yoylecake!

theese are all amazing shows/ movies, and i will be glad if any of them win.

So apparently the average slushie drink originated from glee, huh?

Hi, I'm an admin for the {{SITENAME}} community. Welcome and thank you for your edit to [[:User blog:Asnow89/Battle of the Fantasy Foods- Round ONE]]!

No, it's a peach soda. The Pitt is there because it is talking about the pit of the peach.

You should follow what Cary said. '''Don't spam.''' Just remember that they have control over your life. So please, don't spam.

i love bfdi i cant belive its coming back yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.

YOYLECAKE,YOYELJELLY,YOYELPIE,YOYLEICECREAM,

YOYLE EVERYTHING!!!

Repost this to save yoyelcake!

How far did Pawpsicles get? 

You can get Yoylecake if you don't vote for it either.  It's already in the top four.

Vote Yoylecake. Gravity Falls already won with Smile Dip.

Yoylecake yoylecake yoylecake IT MUST WIN

Pawpsicles is stupid with a stupid name and a stupid taste

David: AWW, SERIOUSLY?!

AGHH I CAN'T DECIDE GRAVITY FALLS OR BFDIA AHHH

yoylecake,yoylcake :D 

i am a fan of yoylecake.i mean, it turns you into metal right?

GO PITT COLA

(idc who wins)

I am saying this....

Due to the spam of "Yolyecake", Pitt Cola will have a high chance to win

Nope

Well,it has yoyleberries so yeah

Lol it's now the finals

They lost on the semis

I saw that you blocked aquatic panic for spamming. What was he spamming? And on the fantasy foods thread on the SU wiki, and he said he wasn't spamming. The real spammers on here are wikia contributors trying to get people to vote for yoylecake. I'm sorry if this causes any drama.<ac_metadata title="Hello."> </ac_metadata>

If yoyleberries don't exist in the real world,that Definetly represents fantasy foods

Pick BFDIA

BFDIA 6 I want him now!!!

STOP SPAMMING

Umm ok I really don't care about who wins because I can't get to get a chance to go and get it 

And Pitt cola is a drink and Yoylecake is a food

So it's soda or cake 

So ya

It

1

To not get blocked on here use a thing I'm useing

What is all this talk about wiki contributors and aquatic panic do with Yoylecake and I don't spam only some of us spam not all of us<ac_metadata title="Hi idk y I&#039;m here"> </ac_metadata>

True true don't blame all of us it just the creator of Yoylecake told all his fans to vote then a wave of fans came and then the spam wave came with the fans if u know what I mean not in a weird way

What kind of berry would ever exist that would turn you into metal?

There's many fans and with fans come spammers who spend all there time trying to trick for a big wave   

And then with spam comes blocking to random strangers we don't know it makes no sense that just a few hours of spamming comes the time to go ill just stop here so ya bye

Umm u can stop reading here this last words might help

Spamming makes you worse than before if u were worse

BYE THEN 

I voted yoylecake!!!

Hi 🍰

It's still a bummer SU was eliminated. But hey, I reached a goal I wanted. Reach semi-finals and have the food be made at NYCC!

Just four days left and the winner will be revealed!

Dude, stop trying to fake having a conversation with yourself. We can see your IP address next to "Wikia Contributor".

yoylecake must win!

VOTE EPIC YOILCAKE

Chipher hunt was amazing, and so was Gravity Falls, but the fact that BFDI went on hiatus for three years and is finally coming back makes me want to vote for Yoylecake.

YOYLE CAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Me right now.[[File:Tough_choice.gif|thumb|292px|Glitchy for a bit.]]

Cake at Stake I

We have 6657 votes.

The cake this time is Yoylecake, Yarana, you got 199 votes so your safe, Skiddley, even SU lost, with 5 more your safe, Imnew7373, avoiding the bottom 2, your safe with 453.

GQ is safe with 1001 votes and Blue Bird i eliminated for the recors of 5000 votes

Let me explain. I got the task to clean up the comments in the Fantasy Food Fight Blog, because staffs saw a lot of spam and glibberish comments. The blog is a highly visible, branded and a flagship program culminating in an event activation at the New York Comic Con and we want to represent Wikia from his best sides, but spam-comments or comments which ''cause'' spam such as these Medical-pictures are not helping to reach the goal of a flagship.

That's why I blocked him for around 3 days, because I want to prevent drama and comment-wars.

Voting for Yoylecake and voting for Pitt Cola is baised on a personal opinion and as long as you dicuss calm or write something funny like [http://recipes.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Thereselovesyou/The_4th_Annual_Battle_of_the_Fantasy_Foods#comm-245300 this] that is fine. I won't judge deleting or blocking people because they vote for the cake.

Okay, This is the words of the recommender of yoylecake. (Me) I would like you to all stop this war. BFDI fans spit out spam. And other fans spit out insults. Insulting and death threats DO NOT do anything. Even the Huang Brothers told everyone to stop commenting, and i would like to end this once and for all!

I did you liar!

o

None,so yoyleberries are Definetly represent "fantasy food"

🌲 days left omg

SAME OMG

I like yoylcake

Good luck with that. Many have tried before you. Some people just won't stop.

If Pitt cola wins, I will smash my keyboard like the Angry German Kid! In PC Speilen. And I will curse up a morherfucking storm, like this, fuck shit you motherfucking dick who is a son of a bitch

I'm Going to eat Yoylecake, Wow turn into the metal. I LOVE YOYLECAKE!!! I Vote Yoylecake... Again.

VOTE YOYLECAKE!!!!!!

Think about it. If Pitt cola wins, they are just gonna make one simple cola coca. Not fun at all. Using unique ones like YOYLECAKE is much more fun so vote for YOYLECAKE. Also, this is not saying YOYLECAKE must win.

Yoyleberries don't exist. That's why the cake is a fantasy food and no one has ever made it.

Yoylecake would be a borning berry cake, pit cola would be a nice peach cola*!

*with a pit in it

It won't turn you into metal.

'''''WHO WILL WIN?'''''

Yoyle cake won

Good point, VOTE YOYLECAKE!!!!!

I REALLY WANT TO TURN INTO METAL :DDDD

r.i.p temby's peabnut bubber

For people who are saying they will vote in Yoylecake or Pitt Cola, stop sending spam, because it is stupid to do that. Just stop

either way they're going to sell pitt cola and yoylecake, stop whining children <3

Yoylecake actually resembels Plum Cakes cause Yoyleberries ar elike Plums

FUCK pitt cola.

AND IN WITH THE CAKE!

The Yoylecake is not a lie.

Pitt Cola is.

Well, I guess all that's really left are:

Fry bits

Fish stew pizza

And Lion lickers

So you block him but don't block the really annoying spammers that spam a single word a million times?

What is Yoylecake anyways?

U guys realize that yoyle cake will literally just be a cake with green and purple frosting? Whereas Pitt cola will actually be something unique. Too bad the atla food didn't win, that would've been cool to see.

Who doesn't want to turn into medal. I want to turn into medal

Go watch BFDI

It seems that opinions differ a lot from person to person, because I thought the exact opposite earlier (and now still) of what you're saying here :/

You know that the creators said to not spam.

Guys. There both gonna get be sold this is just for lol I have a fanbase bigger then yours, so just stop spamming.

pls no not all BFDI likers are idiots, he is just posting his opinion... 

"yoil"?

what have we done

I meant three days not that

Cakeyoyle

✌ ☀️s 👈 

(Two days left)

Yoylecake isn't going to turn you into metal.

A freaking stack of waffles and a delicately made 2 flavor pie, yet the waffles win. (no offense to Steven Universe)

I don't care anymore, I just want YCake to lose.

Lol type ghat the Englich is that

That's true, idek why people care for what wins and what doesn't, both are going to the Wikia food truck no matter what.

You want Ycake to lose, I gonna punch you.

Burn in hell

YoyleCake (98/100)

Pizz Coke (30/100)

YyC. is better than P.C.

P.C. made me baketria. YyC. is metal and not want to die expect lava, so is good.

I hope you have a future glasses :)[[File:BFDI_WON.png|thumb]]

DONT SPAM YOYLECAKE

Yoylecake rules!!!!

Puffball: When BFDI is voting! We will win the prize like I always do. I really love prizes!

Iven. Vang. Have. Vote

lets keep voting yoylecake until we can't vote anymore !

Everyone is just harassing each other in the Battle for Fantasy Foods comment section.

Can you please just disable the comments? It's only going to get worse and worse if you don't.<ac_metadata title="Request"> </ac_metadata>

Same even though I've never tried Yolecake

Uhhh

Sorry but Yolecake won

Yoylecake! We can make it! BFDI

**** you guys go to hell and get 99 years of bad luck

^REALLY I JUST REPLIED TO YOU

Vote BFDI instead.

Just do it!

(Grab rocket launcher) (Bombard you entire family) ^^ to the idiot above me

^^ same to your entire family (if u have any)

I got a feeling that those pitt cola spammer is from the BFDI fandom who want to make GF fandom look bad. Same apply to those BFDI spammers who may be people from other fandom on disguised (but most probably it is really from the BFDI fans because their fanbase is mainly made out of autistic kids who threatened anyone who do not vote YOLYECAKE lol).

YOYLECAKE YOYLECAKE YOYLECAKE!!!!!!

If you truly like BFDI and want it to win the battle, then you won't spam because Cary and Michael told everyone not to.

Iven have   Vote

Iven vote cakes

Pitt Cola use so many chemicals SO NO!

I'm voting YOYLECAKE!

oh my gosh. Stop right now.

I'm also voting Yoylecake.

Me too!

Yoylecake has to win because when you taste it it's so amazing that it will you to metal FOR REAL

So would yoylecake.

It looks like not just BFDI fans spam the comments section..

In that case, I'm voting Yoylecake.

ok im confused one minute its yoylecake spam then pittcola 

THIS IS GOSH DARN INSANITY

Vot yoylecake

im the last person to vote

'''BE CREATIVE.'''

no youre not

Hey Everyone, lets vote: How about you shut the fuck up.

Vote yoylecake. Lets go against idiots like these.

YOYLE CAKE!!!!!!! scerw Pitt Cola

poopacola does anyone dislike it(: BFDI is The best

Nobody can get along these days. :^)

Pitt Cola has a nice pitt in each can though.

Who doesn't like pitts?

Pitt Cola has some goodness in it.

It contains a pitt in every can.

Also, Starspeaker has a point there.

Just dont do it!

I am voting for Pitt Cola, not that it will win or anything, but it gives Gravity Falls that little bit of support.

I don't really watch BFDI, and after seeing what happened this year in the comments section of the BOTFF, I wont be watching it any time soon. Sorry BFDI fans.

Next year I really want to see the Fix-It Felix, Jr 30th Anniversary Cake from Wreck-It Ralph, or Chum from SpongeBob SquarePants.

Me and my admin friend on another wiki get along well, though.

So does another one of my admin friends on another different wiki.

Just because you like Yoylecake doesn't mean you have to offend us Gravity Fallers.

Maybe you can respect Pitt Cola as much as Yoylecake.

The comments section is one loop-de-doop rollercoaster where everything changes 24/7

I hope yoylecake wins..

BFDI isn't by a multibillion dollar company like Gravity falls is. It was made by Cary and Michael Huang when they were 12 years old! BFDI is the one that deserves support

I hope Pitt Cola wins, but good luck to the BFDI fans too. c:

I AM SO EXIDED 4 IT :D

VOTE YOYLECAKE

Vote whatever you want.

(GF ftw)

I dislike how some people just reply '''death threats''' over people who vote something else other then Yoylecake, this has gone way too far.

Those people are probably kids.

Why '''death threats'''.

They should know this is just a contest and even if Pitt Cola wins, Yoylecake will still be sold at the Wikia food cart.

I personally want Yoylecake, but if Pitt Cola wins it'll be okay. It's just a contest.

Naco's from Kim Possible

Omg i found who win wkia when you vote yolyecke and keep open n tommorow we know who win!,yolyecke!!!!!!

I cant believe both of my favourite fantasy foods made it this far.

I would vote Pitt Cola, but yoyle cake is just a bit better :)

Are you even listening? SPAMMING IN THE COMMENTS FOR YOYLECAKE DOES NOT MEAN A VOTE FOR IT.

Let's go yoyle cake make bubble proud

Yoyle cake rules

VOTE YOYLE CAKE!!

leggooo yoyle cake

(this is not a vote you spam nazis)

yoylecake because gravity falls already won one year

you should really watch BFDI

Aww man I LOVE gravity falls and battle for dream island I can't disside!

YOYLECAKE RULEZ!!!!!! VOTE YOYLECAKE!!! GRAVITY FALLS'S PITT COLA IS NOT A FOOD, ITS A DRINK! GRAVITY FALSS ALREADY WON LAST YEAR AND PITT COLA WAS IN 2013 BATTLE OF THE FANTASY FOODS. >:(

YOYLECAKE FOR THE WIN!

YOYLECAKE! Bubble 2011

Screw Gravity Falls, Undertale was better anyways and it lost, so the lesser (gravity falls) should go down too. Plus, the BFDI fandom is too large, along with the hype for the new episode!! Gravity falls already supposedly ended, but the BFDI fandom still has room to grow!!!

Yoyle cake!

Finally,less than a day left!

Good thing the power of earlyness will get me to know the results faster than you Americans lol I'm asian

Bubble: YOYLECKE!

Can't wait for this thing to end.

Do you want Maurice and Patrick on your aliance Bubble?

*arrests StarspeakerTheDragon

I AGREEE

yeah no!

VOTE YOYLECAKE EVERY 5 HRS THAT WILL WORK

A slice of pitt cola lol

Don't be one more to the 1,842 people who spam yoylecake in the comments. Pitt Cola fans,I don't reccomend it either.

One of the only sensible people here

PITT COLA UR DOOMED >:D

Yeah '''YOYLECAKE WON'''

To me,it's not big enough to become the OSF,But we are nearing it. After this,do you think there's gonna be a gigantic flame war after this thing all blows over.

Did you know? ABOUT PITY COLA

From thew word PITT means grose. What do we know because its Bill Cipher's favorite soda.

Trivia #2: ABOUT YOYLECAKE

Being a metal makes you tough NOT BEING HEAVY because its '''yoyle'''metal and it is unfreezable but it helps our future.

But i like together breakfat. '''YOYLECAKE!'''

VOTE YOYLECAKE!!!

P.S. - im not a kid >:(

yoyolcaik

First,I agree that we should all be allowed to vote whatever we want without the flame war going on in the comments.

Im guessing yoylecake is made up of BLUEBERRIES.

Btw yoylecake need to win.

OF YOU EAT PITY COLA, WE KNOPW SODA IS BAD FOR OUR HEALTH >:(

yeah...

..ANYWAY I LIKE YOYLECAKE TOO

Science time!

WHY SODAS, COLAS, SODA BUBBLES, etc. IS BAD FOR OUR HEALTH?

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">The Sugar!</span> – A single can of soda contains the equivalent of <span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">10 teaspoons of sugar</span>. This amount of sugar, especially in liquid form, [http://wellnessmama.com/podcast/stop-sugar-madness/ skyrockets the blood sugar and causes an insulin reaction in the body]. Over time, this can lead to diabetes or insulin resistance, not to mention weight gain and other health problems. Soft drink companies are the largest user of sugar in the country.

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">Phosphoric Acid</span> -Soda contains phosphoric acid, which interferes with the body’s ability to absorb calcium and can lead to osteoporosis, cavities and bone softening. Phosphoric Acid also interacts with stomach acid, slowing digestion and blocking nutrient absorption.

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">Artificial Sweeteners</span>– In diet sodas, aspartame is used as a substitute for sugar, and can actually be more harmful. It has been linked to almost a hundred different health problems including seizures, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, diabetes, and emotional disorders. It converts to methanol at warm temperatures and methanol breaks down to formaldehyde and formic acid. Diet sodas also increase the risk of metabolic syndrome, which causes belly fat, high blood sugar and raised cholesterol.

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">Caffeine</span>– Most sodas contain caffeine, which has been linked to certain cancers, breast lumps, irregular heart beat, high blood pressure, and other problems.

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">The Water</span>– The water used in soda is just simple tap water and can contain chemicals like chlorine, fluoride and traces of heavy metals.

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">Obesity</span>– Harvard researchers have recently positively linked soft drinks to obesity. The study found that 12 year olds who drank soda were more likely to be obese than those who didn’t, and for each serving of soda consumed daily, the risk of obesity increased 1.6 times.

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">Extra Fructose</span>– Sodas contain High Fructose Corn Syrup, which obviously comes from corn. Most of this corn has been genetically modified, and there are no long term studies showing the safety of genetically modified crops, as genetic modification of crops has only been around since the 1990s. Also, the process of making High Fructose Corn Syrup involves traces of mercury, which causes a variety of long term health problems.

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">Lack of Nutrients</span>– There is absolutely no nutritional value in soda whatsoever. Not only are there many harmful effects of soda, but there are not even any positive benefits to outweigh them.  Soda is an unnatural substance that harms the body.

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">Dehydration</span>– Because of the high sugar, sodium and caffeine content in soda, it dehydrates the body and over a long period of time can cause chronic dehydration.

#<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">Bad for the teeth</span>– Drinking soda regularly causes plaque to build up on the teeth and can lead to cavities and gum disease.

0_0

im a gravity falls fan. Well that changes my mind to vote to yoylecake.

so huh you changed? cool

o heres the source: http://wellnessmama.com/379/reasons-to-avoid-soda/

both foods are not healty :(

im voting yoylecake its less unheatly

if you drink pitt cola so many times its will cause you HEART ATTACK

You forgot carbonation-Kinda destroys(or idk) your stomach if you take too much

It's made of yoyleberries

oh thanks for more advise :)

cakes are a little sweet but the soda bubble is what im avoiding for.

Yoylecake has yoyleberries in it

almost everyone wants to turn in the metal (by comments) but me....

Next year,I want to see Dolanade from Super Planet Dolan.

''Dolanade2017''

''Let's make it happen!''

Uhhh... Why did you put the science,even though nobody asked for the science?

I want Yoylecake to win yasss this thing is almost over 

It used to be 64 and then 32 and then 16 and then 8 and then 4 and now final 2 and let's see who will be second place

I never drink soda!I don't even like the taste of it 😣

<span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Georgia,"TimesNewRoman",Times,serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;">However, some cakes are less unhealthy than others, and if you bake your own cakes, you can make substitutions to improve their nutritional profile. </span>

oh cake is a little unhealthy ok i thought cake is so much sweet

Explanation of foods made from yoyleberries,brought to you by the BFDI wiki:

''Y<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">oyleberries are fictional berries which are used to make </span>'''yoylecake'''<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">and </span>'''yoylestew'''.<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Yoyleberry and yoylecake are known to turn the eaters into Yoyle Metal as a side effect, an element which cannot be frozen by </span>'''[http://battlefordreamisland.wikia.com/wiki/Freeze_Juice Freeze Juice]'''<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">.</span>''

I have a story:

When i was 6 to 7 years old, i drinked sodas and colas. When i'm feeling a stomach ache, it hurst so much that i even go to the hospita; and have a recovery for 1 week. From there, i never drink soda but a little.

FUNFACT: Today im drinking Royal

Stop the Yoylecake madness! Avenge all fandoms, lost because of it!

Even if you don't like it, even if they defeated you (Like SU. Still salty)

'''VOTE GRAVITY FALLS  '''and you won't become metal!

Really, I'm done with BFDI shit, I didn't even know that it exists before all this spam.  And asking creators to promote wikia voting is just stupid.

It's '''healthy''',not '''h''''''ealty '''Just saying.

agree, i hope theres no comment section during voting

....but imma bfdi fan

just vote and make peace to everyone

More stupid, is that people can vote more than once, so people, able to be on wikia constantly (a.k.a. children, which BFDI has a lot) get much more votes than adults, with work and stuff

You can't make a cake, that instantly kills you, healthy

Eh. I would rather be metal that could not freeze.

Don't like thsi! Hahahaha:)

Final day 

It ends on 31. August. 2016. 6:00 AM

It's a cake that turns you into metal...

Golf Ball says thanks.

http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/battlefordreamisland/images/5/56/Golf_Ball.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519180816

Even though you may not like Yoylecake, it still deserves a fair chance to win. Although it is true that many brands have been defeated by Yoylecake, an equally large amount have been taken out be Gravity Falls. Lastly, please don't swear at the competition, like in debates. Would you call your opponent a piece of sh** in front of everyone?

I wholeheartedly agree. There is no need to curse at anything. (I'd probably be surprised if someone didn't curse at this comment.)

I agree. Both Yoylecake and Pitt Cola have taken 31 other foods that you might have liked. That doesnt mean one should get more hate. The important thing is to vote fairly.

Hi, I'm an admin for the {{SITENAME}} community. Welcome and thank you for your edit to [[:Pasta Salad with Avocado, Bell Pepper and Feta Cheese]]!

And? Cake is terrible for your health too.

@[http://recipes.wikia.com/wiki/User:ToonEugen6812 ToonEugen6812] I would respect their opinions if they just said they voted for yoylecake but, they told me to vote for yoylecake.

Probably yoylecake because 1000s of 5-year-olds are voting for it.

@[http://recipes.wikia.com/wiki/User:ToonEugen6812 ToonEugen6812] What's a GoFag? And if they can state their opinion so can I.

It's not like you're going to turn into metal.

No it'll be around 11:50pm

it depends where you live

YOYLE CAKE 

Last 10 hours guys! Don't loose your marbles!

WELP I lost them

Please don't spam even jack said not to.

''Go Yoylecake! Go Yoylecake!''

''WE CAN DO IT GUYS! WE MUST OVERWHELM THE COLA! '''THE COLA IS NOT CONSIDERED A FOOD!!!'''''

I hate all the spam comments of bfdi. Although I've never really watched gravity falls and know bfdi better I'll vote for yoylecake.

Yea

Let's do this!!! VOTE YOYLECAKE!!!!!

I think yoylecake will win by 89%-11%

Not as terrible as soda though

YOYOLCAKE!!!

GO YOLE CAKE

Yole cake!

Are you guys serious? Jacknjellify have literally said on countless occasions not to spam 'yoylecake' in the comments.

Hoo boy, only 9 hours left. Personally, I'll be happy if either side wins, although I will still vote for the food I want to vote for. May the best food win.

SODA IS NOT GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH!

'''VOTE YOYLECAKE!'''

Every soda you drink is unhealthy. Cake is less unhealthy than soda and soda is not food, it's a drink.

Vote yoylecake now!

Yoylecake!!!!!!! :D

yoylecake ;)

YOOYLECAKE

@StarspeakerTheDragon

A Gofag is a person who makes grounded videos using the software Go!Animate. They disrespect opinions and think that Go!animate is the best thing since sliced bread.

FTW

YOUYOUCAHKE

YOYLECAKE IS AWESOME

Dude he said not to spam yoylecake

Yep! 62 other foods have bit the dust by either Pitt Cola or Yoylecake. 

Do NOT curse in the comments! Cursing is not a good thing to do ANYWHERE ON THE INTERWEBS.

And no food should get more hate than another. May the best food win!

Yoylecake is the best of the best!

Hi

Yoylecack!

You know, just because of you, I'm voting for Pitt Cola.

Just kidding! I'm voting Pitt Cola anyways.

To anyone who voted Yoylecake in the final round;[[File:I_Am_Gonna_Kill_You.jpg|thumb]]

Uh, guys?

http://fandom.wikia.com/articles/fandom-battle-of-fantasy-foods-winner

EDIT: FORGET THIS LINK, it's broken now.

I can't help it. Yoylecake. there. done.

Broken link

May the best food win

23:00:00 is da end of voting yoylecake

only six hours left! hurry and vote for something!

The fact that a cartoon made by a couple of 12-year olds a few years ago is giving Gravity Falls a run for its money is amazing in and of itself.

I dont vote yoylecake.

I vote yoyleberries.

Pitt Cola, every can comes with its very own pip!

Yote Yoylecake Yote Yoylecake vote Yoylecake for bubble.

Cake is better than Soda

Or Yoylecake is better than Pitt Cola

DUH YOLECAKE

Hi, I'm an admin for the {{SITENAME}} community. Welcome and thank you for your edit to [[:User blog:Asnow89/2015 Battle of the Fantasy Foods - THE FINAL ROUND]]!

its about random objects fighting for an island and some cake with berries from a even more randomer island.

it's about 20 (later 21) objects fighting for a luxury island in an animated, elimination-centric, reality show-esque manner

8 p.m. here in Mexico 🇲🇽

I can tell which comment was written by the BfDI fan and which was written by a neutral party

Who ever wants soda

Truly, there are some devoted fans to Yoylecake. Is it possible that Jack meant comment on his videos? But one question:What does Jellify think? (JackandJellify)

I'm only going to vote because I want all of the fans to be happy

You do realise that 'Jack and Jellify' isn't their actual names? Their real names are Michael and Cary Hung. By the way, they actively discouraged commenting Yoylecake on the wikia page. They explicitly said 'Don't comment, vote' on both of their videos for voting on Yoylecake.

Undertale is just a fad, bud. Just like FNaF was.

rip in papyrus' pasta

Yoylecake FTW

"helps our future"

'''...'''

'''What??'''

vote vote vooooooooooote yoylecake

For the lost city of Yoyle land ! And Bubble and Leafy

Both BFDI and Pitt Cola spammers are putting a bad name on their fandoms like https://youtu.be/5RAQXg0IdfI?t=7

vote yoylecake

^ Can't tell if sarcasm or a genuine question.

If it's a genuine question, then just look at these comments.

Otherwise, hey, it's comedy.

That's reasonable enough.

I personally think Gravity Falls is the best thing since sliced bread, but that's just me.

What bores me is action without plot.

I think it's just one guy doing that. They need to stop.

But seriously, I see more Yoylecake spam than there is Pitt Cola spam.

yoyal cake

https://youtu.be/2k0SmqbBIpQ?t=2

yoylecake MUST WIN!

Pppl VOTE YOYLECAKEEEE

Sorry yoylecake

Something weird just happened. I was checking the comments and the words "Next" and "Previous" were in German 🇩🇪

Hello.I am Bombrange64. As you may know,I am named after a bomb range.I am pretty MLG and have never made a Go!Animate video.

Basically,it's the worst thing since the edsel.

/thread<ac_metadata title="Hello"> </ac_metadata>

Go youle cake

WHAT YOUR CRAZZY

Both Yoyle Cake and Pitt Cola are already part of the foods that they're really making. But soon we'll find out who is the better fandom! [[File:Icyface.gif|right]][[File:JLwLA.gif|left]]

(even though the BFDI fandom has no self control)

Don't blame an entire fandom for a few of its members, they are the few that are the youngest.

*yoyole*

https://youtu.be/_CqPeyxsHS0?t=6

Yep.

''*YOYLE''

Weren't we all told to stop spamming this?

Me too I agree

Whichever one wins isn't the better fandom, it just has better food.

GO YOYLECAKE!!!!

Yeah they were but, 1st graders never do what their told.

[[File:Pitt_Cola.gif|thumb|Bipper Approved!]]

Stop spaming.

Lets go yoyle cake please win

I like men

I made a vid on my channel for YOYLECAKE check it out! 

Channel: Galaxy bunny 2.0

(THIS COUNTS AS A VOTE FOR YOYLECAKE)

in the words of cary and micheal of their own video:

COMMENTS DONT COUNT AS VOTES

IF YOU WANNA VOTE WHATEVER ACTUALLY VOTE

ITS NOT LIKE BFDI SEASON 1 WHERE YOU COMMENT TO VOTE

CLICK THE BUTTON

No it doesn't! To vote, you have to click on the matchup that you want to vote on, and then click the vote button under the food you want to vote for. (In this case, it's YOYLECAKE!!!)

May the best food win.

again

Are you even kidding me? Everyone else is going for Yoylecake. I just bet you're going to lose.

The better one has to be Yoylecake, because there are mostly BFDI fans. So that means YouTube is the new TV!

GO YOYOLCAEK!

(BTW, this is a cheerleader post, not a vote. I understand how this works.)

BTW, hope you all are feeling WELL READ, because it's all going to Yoyleca-

*gets frozen by Book

I'm voting for Yoylecake but best of luck to all Pitt Cola fans! :) (← that is the first smiley emoji I've seen in this comment section. Everyone is getting so serious about this but it's just for fun!)

I Swear, every single Time

10 pm

Last hour

Oh my paper that was hilarious

Final hour...which community will emerge triumphant?

Sort of intense but I'm pretty sure BFDI's food will win.

Wow vote yoylecake

Its a fact that Yoylecake will win. Cheers to jacknjellify!

Did voting end, because if it didn't, where do I go to vote?

94% to yoylecake! Congratulations and horray for the BOTFF 2016!

Yoylecake won!!!!!!!!!!!!!

WOOP WOOP WE WON :3 X3 BFDI FOR LIFE NOW WE HAVE TO WATIT 2 DAYS AND WE SHALL BEEEE FOREVER HAPPYY

Who won?

Yoyle cake or Pitt cola?

Yoylecake = 94%

Pitt Cola = 6%

I was expecting Yoylecake to win, but not by this much. 94% is kind of a lot considering how huge the Gravity Falls fandom is and how many people are against the little kids spamming in comments. But yay we did it!

The Battle of the Fantasy Foods has come toan end. BFDI Yoylecake won, with 94% of votes. Pitt Cola lost, with ONLY 6%. Congrats to the Top 32 that made it!

Yoylecake with 94%! Congratulations to all the competitors. Horray for the BOTFF 2016!

94 to 6? seems a bit unbalanced

Yoylecake won! That's great (I guess), since I actually prefer it over Pitt Cola and Gravity Falls itself.

yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

Yes!we did it!!!

I know right. Must be all the kids.

Congratulations,Jacknjellinfy. We won!!!

YES, YOLYLECAKE

Yayayayayyayayay you're ale you're cake you're cake

YOYLE FTW

*Bubble shedding tears of joy

CONGRATS YOYLECAKE WE WON

Whoopie

Oh wow, Yoylecake won!

yesssssssss

triplet brothers and my sister, are you watching this??? this is AWESOME!!

WHOOO HOOO YOYELL CAKE WON :D

WE DID IT! #1 SEED IS VICTORIOUS!

Woop!

In YouTube,watch this video:"Yoylecake won!!!!"

-Bubble

😂😂😂

Yoy! :3

Okay, Yoylecake won. Not entirely unbelievable, I'm sure... Whatever obscure show it's from has some dedicated fans.

But winning by '''''94% vs. the ridiculously popular Gravity Falls food's 6%????'''''

Bullshit. I'm calling bot voting.

Not bot voting, just serious commitment.

damn man you don't need to be rude

...well...i guess we were the only one caring about the competition then?

Stfu we're not kids

Yay Yoylecake I hate gravity falls

WOW, 94 against 6, that`s cool

:p

Wow, Yoylecake at 94%. Congrats and BOTFF has really been fun to be apart of!

Hey ice cube

Wha?

We won!

Ikr

So, The Battle is finally over, with the food I supported In top spot. So I'd like to say good try to gravity falls, I have to say I do like the show, but I had to vote yoylecake in the final. Good try to every fandom who was nominated for this, we had some big names here and I wasn't sure we'd be able to beat them. We've been pitted against Portal, CoD, Breadwinners,Zootopia, and Gravity Falls, and some of the rounds we didn't think we'd win.

Good Game.

They yolocake fandom voted for GF since they knew GF fandom is already dwindling and easy to beat. If SU would've been there, we could've possibly one.

YAAAAAYYY

HEH YOYLECAKE WON >:D

Cake has only 3 reason why its unhealthy but less unhealthy THAT SODA HAS MORE THAN 10 REASON

Wow, Yoylecake won by a massive landslide. Good thing the new episode is coming tomorrow.

Yoylecake win yay!!!!!!

Im pretty sure I was the reason yoylcake won! I voted multiple time each and every day!

I tried extra hard for the zootopia pawpsicles. I thought they were gonna win!

This thing is rigged.

Probaly not as being jacknjellify (Creators of Battle for Dream Island) mobilised their 166k subscribers to vote for yoyle cake.

 

Yoyle cake   Annihilated Pitt cola.

GG Other foods, hope u had fun :3

I cant even belive we won against portal so easy still

YOYLECAKE WON!!!!!

me neither no only u

Match: Yeah we won, we won right?

ALL: YAY!!!

stopit 

P.S. even i am a BFDI fan

LOOK ITS LEGOTD61 FROM TWOWSO!

well, jacknjellify did make 3 videos based on making them vote for yoylecake. and it started right when bfdia6 was announced so of course they would vote for yoylecake for bfdia6

YOYLE CAKE WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Hmm, i wonder if yoylecake won.

um ok who botted lol

SARCASM, STOP IT

According to my Calculations,

There are 94% of the voter who voted yoylecake. Lets say Cary and Michael (JackandJellify) has 166,000 subs. But not all sunbscribers of him voted. So let's just say there are about 145K subs who voted yoylecake meaning the 96% of the voters is about 14,000. So lets divide 14,000 by 96.

14,000 / 96 = 145.83 (rounding) 146 voters.

And by that, about 146 voters has 1%. 146 times 6% is a whopping descending about 876 voters.

CAN YOU BELEIVE IT!? ABOUT 1,000 VOTERS VOTE PITT COLA BUT A MASSIVE 145K VOTED YOYLECAKE.

That is my calcuations.

Also Bubble wants "Ice Cream Cake" so i want to suggest Cary and Michael to have that cake next year.

Also lets have a hashtag topic #OneAndForAHundredForty

Where is the timer?! I couldn't find it lol

I voted multiple times per day too!

WorldanGo you forgot moo moo milk

its over

Oh lol

OMG Yoylecake won!

yes yoylecake is won finally!!!!

YAS! YOYLECAKE WON!!!!

yoylecake has won :)

YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY yoylecake won! Now bfdia 6 can come out

YOYLE CAKE!!! 

Yoylecake may have won by that huge majority vote, but supporters of Pit Cola need not be upset. After all, this is only one loss. Perhaps you could support it in ways other than swearing at Yoylecake!

Admitted, I am on the side of Yoylecake.

And The Winner Is Yoylecake From BFDI

Well, I guess I had nothing to worry about, with Yoylecake's crazy victory. Gg to Gravity Falls fans, I know they voted their hearts out.

YES YOYLECAKE WON AND PITTCOLA LOSE

A lot of BFDI fans are little kids that don't have accounts.

VICTORY FOR YOYLE CAKE!!! BUBBLE WILL BE HAPPY!!!!!!

Yay

Yoyle cake toke home the CAKE!!!

... i would have an account if i wanted to

Waaa Pitt cola lost

Apparently they did'nt vote their hearts out, only 6% of people voted for pitt cola...

Yes!bubble will be so happy

YOYLECAKE!!!!!!

BUBBLE'S DAY IS MADE!

BUBBLE SAYS YOYLECAKE!

Wow 6% to 94% YOYLECAKE!!!

how old ARE you then?

Eh. Yoylecake won since the creator said to vote for it. 

But, they'll both be served at Comic Con, so it didn't really matter.

the comments: spams, happy kids yaying yoylecake, "STOP SPAMMING!!!", "seek medical help" memes,etc. meanwhile there's me who just reads all of them.....

...yeah. (I need to get a life)

Seeing that Yoylecake won, fills me with joy, celebration, and some DETERMINATION.

Yes yolecake won

MOM GET THE CAMERA YOYLECAKE WON

Yes!

YOYLECAKE WON, YAY!!!

Gravity Falls won before anyways, I guess it's BFDI's time to shine.

TBH Smile Dip is better than Pitt Cola.

[[File:83d16bc81c3853461691103040fb1526-d8nomg9.png|thumb|CONGRATS BFDI]]

yoylecake made it. :') i cannot believe it! (that was a tear of joy)

I need to get a life, too! :D

Just as easily, Alex Hirch, Rebecca Sugar/Crewniverse, or teh creator of any of these could have told their fans online to vote.

:(:

i'm too tough to cry

(just today i was crying about snakes though)

Wait!Did you mean me???

WE WON!!!!!!!!!

Ima kid but i have a YouTube account

I hope yoylecake won so I did it!

Yoylecake won..... by a lot.

Well it did beat Portal,Call of Duty,Breadwinners,Pokémon,Zootopia and Gravity Falls so.....

Every food did great....... (Also I was surprised that Undertale and Minecraft lost in round 2 and 3)

Me right now:

[[File:Pen's_we_did_it_pose.png|thumb|We did it!]]

So do I.

Which means you hate LegoBoy I guess .-. He likes Breadwinners (I don't know what it is so DONT hate me but I like LegoBoyNJ for a reason)

GF won, in 2014 with Smile Dip, I think.

The GF fanbase has shrunk since the end of Cipher Hunt.

Expect that to happen.

All Wikia contributers botted.

Including you.

CONGRATS TO EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR YOYLECAKE I AM SO HAPPY :D

YoyleCake Votes Is Over 94.0%

YESSSSSSSS I KNEW IT WE WON WE WON WE WON

Freesmarters:YEAHHH

Match:WE WON WE WON WE WON

I read all the comments because people are a bit butthurt.

YOYLECAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

GG, everybody. It was good to indroduce the object show community to all the other fandoms.

YOLECACK  

YES WE WON THIS TIME, FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE OSC

You can stop spamming, you won.

I want to vote yolecake

Bfdi fans (like me) won! YES!!!! YOYLECAKE IS VICTORIOUS!

YOYLECAKE WON!

Yep,Gravity Falls had won in 2014  with Smile Dip. GET USED TO IT!

Good job BFDI fans! You did it, yay! Mostly because of the video Jacknjellify posted. I bet if Alex Hirsch had posted a video about Season Three of Gravity Falls coming out, and told everyone to vote for pitt cola, then the GF fans woulda won, Because duh SEASON THREE! But he Didn't. I guess we were tired of this becasue of the last two times and Alex Hirsh wat tweeting to vote then, and now its like, eh. But I'm happy for all the BFDI fans and also, this introduced me to BFDI whis is REALLY FUNNY! and now I can't wait untill tomorrow!! It's just too bad there was so much Spamming this year. :(

Golf ball thanks you for the maths.

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD YOYLECAKE AND BFDI ROCK 

Congrats Yoyle Cake and the object show community(but no to the ones who kept spamming yoyle cake everywhere! Although I'm a bit surprised by how it won by 90%. I guess the Gravity Falls fandom seemed to care less about this contest after it ended several months ago. Either that or the object show community is filled with young children with no self control. [[File:Yoylecake.gif|frame|"Yoyle Cake!"]]

Sorry, Bill but it looks like people stopped making deals to win this contest since you're dead!

[[File:Tumblr_o2m7vxnD8E1rz6w0do2_540.gif|thumb|400px|"What's happening to ME?!"]]

Yoylecake won with 94% Pitt cola lost with 6%

About the second largest loss.

I love BFDI and object shows but Gravity Falls is way better. If something is over, it doesn't mean it's dead. I mean, Pitt Cola survive almost all the rounds!

94% to 6%

The Second largest loss The Largest being 97& to 3%

"Yoyle Cake" #Yoyle Cake wins

TRUE DAT DUDE

Yay!!! Yoylecake won

Pearl, calm down! Just relax! [[File:Pearl_angry_steven_universe.gif|right]]

omg bill

Yay yoyocake won

So BFDI fans have the right to spam Yoyle Cake but Gravity Falls fans aren't supposed to say anything about Pitt Cola winning.. 

Was a fair game.

'''IMPORTANT[[File:Yoylecake-deal-with-it-o.gif|thumb|301px|It turns you into metal.]]'''

I'm pretty sure they're making a real life version of Pitt Cola too. They're obviously making a real life Yoyle Cake too since they're the winner of the 2016 Battle of Fantasy Foods.

Lima Beans are absolutely NOT butter beans nor anything like them except for the shape.  Why oh why am I unable to get these delicious beans in the UK?  I have recipes in which a substitute is totally unacceptable.

what does this mean "not good to look at for research"?

Then vote yoylecake all day long!!!

Me too, my grandma from Key West, every cuban sandwich shop had them, Bollos - and tropical milkshakes, nobody makes them anymore, i don't know why but YES this is the real deal. maybe you need self rising flour becasue the key to making it bread-like is a touch of yeast

It's common practice to keep some of the noodle water for later use. It's full of starch that will help make the sauce better! I think the hard part of making Carbonara is getting the timing right. When you mix the cheese with the eggs and the noodles, you can add some of the water to get a more creamy sauce. Look up an italian chef do it. It's just a timing thing!!!

==Description==

Similar to the original FIlipino-style version used for barbecue, this red-hot, oriental barbecue sauce is made with authentic herbs and spices and is great on meat, chicken, and seafood. Soy sauce and rosemary sometimes work for this, too.[[File:Bbqsauce640-589ea47b5f9b58819c9d6fd5.jpg|thumb|Thai Barbecue Sauce]]

==Ingredients==

*4 tablespoons oyster sauce

*3 tablespoons ketchup

*2 tablespoons molasses

*1 tablespoon fish sauce

*1 tablespoon lime juice

*1 tablespoon honey

*3-4 cloves garlic, minced

*1 thumb-size piece ginger, grated

*1 fresh red chili, minced

*2-7 tablespoons chili sauce

==Directions==

#Combine all ingredients in a bowl, stirring until they are well blended.

#Taste-test your barbecue sauce, adding more honey if it is not sweet enough, or more lime juice if it is too sweet or too salty for your taste. Also, add more chili if desired.

#It is great with steak, ribs, burgers, salmon, shrimp, poultry, and more. Spoon, funnel, or pour contents from the homemade barbecue sauce into a fresh glass or plastic jar and reserve this in the refrigerator.

#Use the homemade barbecue sauce as a marinade for meat, poultry, or seafood, and brush it on while grilling, roasting, or frying later.

Thank you. My grandparents were all from Latvia and served this soup often. I have looked for this “comfort” recipe for years! 💜

I made the recipe as indicated but it never reached 275  as indicated.The recipe when I poured it out onto a tray and when it set was sticky never haedwnwd. 

I would not recommend this recipe..

Be cautious with the beer and do not add the entire quantity at once but add until the consistency  is to your liking. An additional egg yolk won't hurt.

not bad for a poor website

Roughly 1 cup pecans

1 cup butter

1 cup sugar

A pinch salt

A couple handfuls of chocolate chips

Line a baking sheet/pan-type-thingamabob with parchment paper and scatter the pecans around the bottom.

Boil the sugar, butter, and salt over low heat until it reaches 300 F, or 'Hard Crack' on a candy thermometer. If the ingredients start to separate, turn off the heat and stir until they re-combine.

Pour the sugar mixture into your baking sheet/pan-type-thingamabob and let it cool for a bit. Before it's completely cooled, put the chocolate chips on top. Once they melt, spread them around evenly.

Let it cool completely, then eat it all before anyone sees you.

I love to fuck and suck cock Don't even say im a hoe 'cause i know I am

Ingredients

US Customary - Metric

12 small Indian Eggplant (if they are not available, use Japanese eggplant and slice them in long 8 long pieces)<br />2 Tbsp oil (to stir fry the eggplants)<br />For Spice Mix<br />1 tsp cumin seeds (jeera)<br />1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds (mathi)<br />1 Tbsp coriander seeds (sabut dhania)<br />10 cashews crushed (kaju)<br />1 Tbsp sesame seeds (til)<br />2 Tbsp coconut powder (gola)<br />For Gravy<br />2 Tbsp oil<br />1/2 tsp black mustard seeds (rai)<br />1/8 tsp asafetida (hing)<br />1/2 tsp turmeric (haldi)<br />1 tsp red chili powder<br />1 tsp sugar<br />1-1/2 tsp salt<br />1 Tbsp tamarind paste<br />2 tomatoes (cut them in small pieces will make 1-1/2 cup puree)<br />1 tsp chopped ginger<br />2 Tbsp chopped cilantro for garnish

Method

Make a slit into eggplants, but not cutting them into half. If you are using Japanese eggplant slice them in 8 long pieces.

Heat the oil in flat frying pan over low medium heat and stir-fry eggplant rotating occasionally till they are tender not mushy. Set them aside.

For the spice mix take all the ingredients, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, coriander seeds, cashews, sesame seeds, coconut powder and grind them in fine powder. Set aside.

Blend tomatoes and ginger together to make into fine puree. Set aside.

Heat the flat frying pan over low medium heat, I am using the same pan I stir fry the eggplants. When oil is moderately hot add the mustard seeds as they crack turn off the heat. Add all the spices asafetida, turmeric, red chili powder and dry spice mix stir for about 2 minutes, all the spices should be roasted.

Add tomato puree, sugar, salt and about 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste. Stir fry the gravy until mix become little thick and start leaving the oil from sides. Add 1/2 cup of water and bring it boil.

Add the eggplant spreading in the frying pan, stir gently cover the pan lower the heat to low and let it simmer for about 7-8 minutes stirring occasionally.

Eggplant should be soft and tender not mushy and coated well with the spices. Adjust the gravy thickness to your choice. Add the cilantro stir gently.

Hello, I love Middle East Food and I cook a lot of it. Coming from one Damascene parent and other relatives, I learned and find that it is the best, healthiest, etc. My problem: I'd love to purchase an entire Leg of Lamb and currently, it's far too expensive. Decades ago, you could purchase Roasts for $5.00. Now the prices are formidable. We use Yogurt, Cumin, S&P, Garlic and Garlic Powder, Saffron, Allspice, Coriander and Rosemary. We also cook Ground Lamb w/egg, Onion, dried Mint, called Ushay.
